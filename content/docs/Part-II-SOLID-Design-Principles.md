<strong>Part II of "Software Design Patterns in Rust" dives deep into the SOLID design principles, essential for building scalable and maintainable software. Starting with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), it emphasizes the importance of having one reason for a class to change, promoting clarity and focus in code. This part then explores the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which advocates for software entities to be open for extension but closed for modification, thus enhancing flexibility and reducing bug risks. It proceeds with the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), ensuring that subclasses can replace their base classes without altering the program's correctness. The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) underscores the need for clients to rely only on interfaces that are relevant to them, avoiding the complications of overly broad interfaces. Finally, the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is discussed, highlighting the importance of depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations to foster modularity and ease of testing. This section aims to provide a thorough grounding in these principles, setting the stage for robust software design.</strong>
