<strong>Chapter 6, "A Tour of Rust - GoF Design Patterns," provides an introductory overview of the 23 design patterns identified by the Gang of Four (GoF), focusing on their application in Rust. The chapter categorizes these patterns into three main groups: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. It briefly describes the purpose and key characteristics of each category, providing examples of major patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Adapter, Composite, Observer, and Strategy. The discussion highlights how Rustâ€™s unique features, such as ownership, lifetimes, traits, and enums, align with or differ from traditional implementations of these patterns in other languages. The chapter emphasizes the adaptability of GoF patterns in Rust, even in the context of the languageâ€™s emphasis on safety and concurrency. While not delving deeply into each pattern, the chapter sets the stage for a deeper exploration in subsequent chapters or further studies, illustrating the timeless relevance and utility of these design patterns in crafting robust, maintainable software.</strong>

## 6.1. Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The GoF patterns are systematically categorized into three principal types: creational, structural, and behavioral. This classification is pivotal in understanding the distinct roles that each type of pattern plays in software design and how they contribute to creating effective and maintainable systems.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Creational</strong> patterns primarily address the complexities associated with object creation. Their goal is to abstract and simplify the process of instantiating objects, which can often involve intricate logic. By doing so, creational patterns help manage object creation in a way that enhances flexibility and control. They enable developers to centralize and streamline object creation processes, making it easier to modify or extend the system without altering the existing codebase significantly. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the exact types of objects to be created may vary or need to be decided at runtime.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Structural</strong> patterns, on the other hand, concentrate on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. These patterns are designed to ensure that the components of a system fit together harmoniously, allowing for effective organization and management of complex systems. Structural patterns help address challenges related to the composition and organization of classes and objects, ensuring that they work together in a cohesive manner. This includes managing relationships between objects and classes to improve code reusability and maintainability while avoiding problems such as tight coupling.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Behavioral</strong> patterns focus on the interactions and responsibilities between objects. They are concerned with how objects collaborate and communicate to achieve their objectives, optimizing the flow of control and data between them. These patterns help define clear and efficient ways for objects to interact, handle operations, and distribute responsibilities, which is crucial for creating systems where components work together seamlessly. By clarifying and managing the communication paths and responsibilities among objects, behavioral patterns contribute to reducing complexity and improving the overall design of the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Understanding these three categoriesâ€”creational, structural, and behavioralâ€”provides a foundational perspective on how different patterns address various aspects of software design. This classification not only helps in grasping the specific purpose and application of each pattern but also sets the stage for a deeper exploration of how these patterns can be adapted and utilized in different programming contexts, including modern languages and frameworks.
</p>

## 6.2. Creational Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Creational design patterns focus on simplifying and controlling the process of object creation, addressing the complexities involved in instantiating objects in a flexible and efficient manner. These patterns are designed to abstract the instantiation process from the client code, allowing for more manageable and adaptable object creation mechanisms. The primary goal is to ensure that object creation is handled in a way that enhances flexibility, promotes reuse, and accommodates varying requirements at runtime without compromising the integrity of the system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key creational patterns include the Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global point of access to it. The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. The Abstract Factory pattern builds on this by providing an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for different representations using the same construction process. Finally, the Prototype pattern involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, thus facilitating the creation of objects with similar configurations. Each of these patterns addresses different aspects of object creation, providing tailored solutions to common challenges in managing and constructing objects within a software system.
</p>

### 6.2.1. Singleton
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. In Rust, this can be implemented using <code>static</code> variables combined with synchronization primitives to ensure thread safety. Hereâ€™s an example of a Singleton pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

struct Singleton {
    value: i32,
}

impl Singleton {
    fn get_instance() -> Arc<Mutex<Singleton>> {
        static mut INSTANCE: Option<Arc<Mutex<Singleton>>> = None;
        unsafe {
            INSTANCE.get_or_insert_with(|| Arc::new(Mutex::new(Singleton { value: 42 }))).clone()
        }
    }

    fn get_value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}

fn main() {
    let singleton = Singleton::get_instance();
    let singleton = singleton.lock().unwrap();
    println!("Singleton value: {}", singleton.get_value());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Singleton</code> is a struct that we want to ensure has only one instance. The <code>get_instance</code> method uses a static mutable variable to hold the single instance of <code>Singleton</code>. The <code>Option</code> type is used to initialize the instance only once, using <code>get_or_insert_with</code> to safely create and store it. <code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code> are employed to ensure thread safety, allowing safe access to the singleton instance across multiple threads. In the <code>main</code> function, <code>get_instance</code> is called to retrieve the singleton, and the <code>Mutex</code> is locked to access the <code>Singleton</code> instance and print its value. This approach ensures that the singleton instance is shared and synchronized across different parts of the application.
</p>

### 6.2.2. Factory Method
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful for delegating the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle. In Rust, this can be implemented using traits to define a factory interface and concrete types to implement specific object creation logic. Hereâ€™s an example of the Factory Method pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Product {
    fn describe(&self) -> String;
}

struct ConcreteProductA;
struct ConcreteProductB;

impl Product for ConcreteProductA {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductA".to_string()
    }
}

impl Product for ConcreteProductB {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductB".to_string()
    }
}

trait Creator {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product>;
}

struct ConcreteCreatorA;
struct ConcreteCreatorB;

impl Creator for ConcreteCreatorA {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductA)
    }
}

impl Creator for ConcreteCreatorB {
    fn factory_method(&self) -> Box<dyn Product> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductB)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let creator_a = ConcreteCreatorA;
    let creator_b = ConcreteCreatorB;
    
    let product_a = creator_a.factory_method();
    let product_b = creator_b.factory_method();
    
    println!("{}", product_a.describe());
    println!("{}", product_b.describe());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Product</code> trait defines a common interface for products with a <code>describe</code> method. <code>ConcreteProductA</code> and <code>ConcreteProductB</code> implement this trait, representing different types of products. The <code>Creator</code> trait defines a <code>factory_method</code> that subclasses must implement to return a specific <code>Product</code>. <code>ConcreteCreatorA</code> and <code>ConcreteCreatorB</code> are concrete implementations of <code>Creator</code>, each returning an instance of a different product type through their <code>factory_method</code>. In the <code>main</code> function, the factory methods of the creators are called to instantiate and describe products. This setup demonstrates how the Factory Method pattern allows for the creation of objects through a flexible and extendable interface, enabling different product types to be instantiated depending on the creator used.
</p>

### 6.2.3. Abstract Factory
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is used when a system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented, ensuring that products from different families can work together seamlessly. In Rust, this can be implemented using traits to define abstract factories and their methods for creating products, along with concrete implementations for specific product families. Hereâ€™s an example of the Abstract Factory pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait ProductA {
    fn describe(&self) -> String;
}

trait ProductB {
    fn describe(&self) -> String;
}

trait AbstractFactory {
    fn create_product_a(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductA>;
    fn create_product_b(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductB>;
}

struct ConcreteFactory1;
struct ConcreteFactory2;

impl ProductA for ConcreteProductA1 {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductA1".to_string()
    }
}

impl ProductB for ConcreteProductB1 {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductB1".to_string()
    }
}

impl ProductA for ConcreteProductA2 {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductA2".to_string()
    }
}

impl ProductB for ConcreteProductB2 {
    fn describe(&self) -> String {
        "I am ConcreteProductB2".to_string()
    }
}

impl AbstractFactory for ConcreteFactory1 {
    fn create_product_a(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductA> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductA1)
    }
    
    fn create_product_b(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductB> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductB1)
    }
}

impl AbstractFactory for ConcreteFactory2 {
    fn create_product_a(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductA> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductA2)
    }
    
    fn create_product_b(&self) -> Box<dyn ProductB> {
        Box::new(ConcreteProductB2)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let factory1 = ConcreteFactory1;
    let factory2 = ConcreteFactory2;
    
    let product_a1 = factory1.create_product_a();
    let product_b1 = factory1.create_product_b();
    
    let product_a2 = factory2.create_product_a();
    let product_b2 = factory2.create_product_b();
    
    println!("{}", product_a1.describe());
    println!("{}", product_b1.describe());
    println!("{}", product_a2.describe());
    println!("{}", product_b2.describe());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>ProductA</code> and <code>ProductB</code> traits define interfaces for two types of products, while <code>AbstractFactory</code> provides methods for creating these products. <code>ConcreteFactory1</code> and <code>ConcreteFactory2</code> are concrete implementations of the <code>AbstractFactory</code>, each responsible for creating a specific set of product instances (<code>ConcreteProductA1</code>, <code>ConcreteProductB1</code>, <code>ConcreteProductA2</code>, <code>ConcreteProductB2</code>). In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>ConcreteFactory1</code> and <code>ConcreteFactory2</code> are used to create products and demonstrate how different families of products can be created through a common interface. This example illustrates the Abstract Factory patternâ€™s capability to ensure that products from different families are compatible and can be used interchangeably, depending on the factory implementation.
</p>

### 6.2.4. Builder
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful for creating objects with many optional components or configurations while maintaining a clear and controlled construction process. In Rust, the Builder pattern can be implemented using a builder struct that accumulates configuration options and a method to build the final object. Hereâ€™s an example of the Builder pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Car {
    make: String,
    model: String,
    year: u16,
    color: Option<String>,
}

struct CarBuilder {
    make: String,
    model: String,
    year: u16,
    color: Option<String>,
}

impl CarBuilder {
    fn new(make: &str, model: &str, year: u16) -> Self {
        CarBuilder {
            make: make.to_string(),
            model: model.to_string(),
            year,
            color: None,
        }
    }

    fn set_color(&mut self, color: &str) -> &mut Self {
        self.color = Some(color.to_string());
        self
    }

    fn build(&self) -> Car {
        Car {
            make: self.make.clone(),
            model: self.model.clone(),
            year: self.year,
            color: self.color.clone(),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut builder = CarBuilder::new("Toyota", "Corolla", 2024);
    builder.set_color("Red");
    let car = builder.build();
    
    println!("Car: {} {} {}", car.make, car.model, car.year);
    if let Some(color) = car.color {
        println!("Color: {}", color);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Car</code> struct represents the complex object being built, with fields for make, model, year, and an optional color. The <code>CarBuilder</code> struct provides a fluent interface for setting these fields. The <code>new</code> method initializes the builder with required fields (<code>make</code>, <code>model</code>, <code>year</code>), while the <code>set_color</code> method allows for setting the optional color. The <code>build</code> method constructs the final <code>Car</code> object using the accumulated settings from the builder. In the <code>main</code> function, the builder is used to create a <code>Car</code> instance with a specified color, demonstrating how the Builder pattern facilitates flexible and controlled object creation.
</p>

### 6.2.5. Prototypes
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Prototype pattern enables the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than constructing new instances from scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new instance is higher than copying an existing one, and it supports the creation of complex objects with similar characteristics. In Rust, the Prototype pattern can be implemented by defining a trait for cloning prototypes and then using concrete types that implement this trait. Hereâ€™s an example of the Prototype pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::rc::Rc;

trait Prototype {
    fn clone(&self) -> Rc<dyn Prototype>;
}

struct ConcretePrototype {
    data: String,
}

impl Prototype for ConcretePrototype {
    fn clone(&self) -> Rc<dyn Prototype> {
        Rc::new(ConcretePrototype {
            data: self.data.clone(),
        })
    }
}

fn main() {
    let original = Rc::new(ConcretePrototype {
        data: "Original Data".to_string(),
    });

    let clone = original.clone();

    println!("Original data: {}", original.data);
    println!("Cloned data: {}", clone.data);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Prototype</code> trait defines a <code>clone</code> method, which is responsible for creating a new instance by copying the existing one. <code>ConcretePrototype</code> is a struct that implements this trait, with the <code>clone</code> method creating a new <code>ConcretePrototype</code> with the same data. The <code>clone</code> method returns an <code>Rc<dyn Prototype></code> to enable reference counting and shared ownership. In the <code>main</code> function, an original instance of <code>ConcretePrototype</code> is created and cloned, demonstrating how the Prototype pattern allows for efficient object creation by copying an existing instance. This approach is beneficial when the creation of new instances involves complex setup or initialization.
</p>

## 6.3. Structural Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Structural design patterns focus on the organization and composition of classes and objects, aiming to ensure that they fit together effectively and efficiently. These patterns are concerned with how to compose objects into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and ensuring that the components work seamlessly together. The purpose of structural patterns is to address issues related to the arrangement and integration of objects and classes, enhancing the overall design and manageability of complex systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Among the key structural patterns are the Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns. The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another that clients expect. The Bridge pattern separates an abstraction from its implementation, enabling both to evolve independently. The Composite pattern facilitates the composition of objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, treating individual objects and compositions uniformly. The Decorator pattern dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without altering their structure. The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with. The Flyweight pattern reduces the cost of creating and managing a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts. Lastly, the Proxy pattern controls access to another object, providing a surrogate or placeholder that manages access and operations. These patterns collectively improve code organization and flexibility, making it easier to manage and extend complex systems.
</p>

### 6.3.1. Adapter
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is useful for integrating new code with existing code that was designed with a different interface. In Rust, the Adapter pattern can be implemented by defining a trait for the expected interface and creating an adapter struct that implements this trait while internally using an instance of a different type that has a different interface. Hereâ€™s an example of the Adapter pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Target {
    fn request(&self) -> String;
}

struct Adaptee {
    specific_request: String,
}

impl Adaptee {
    fn specific_request(&self) -> String {
        self.specific_request.clone()
    }
}

struct Adapter {
    adaptee: Adaptee,
}

impl Target for Adapter {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        self.adaptee.specific_request()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let adaptee = Adaptee {
        specific_request: "Adaptee specific request".to_string(),
    };
    let adapter = Adapter { adaptee };

    println!("Adapter request: {}", adapter.request());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Target</code> trait defines the interface that the client expects, with a method <code>request</code>. <code>Adaptee</code> is a class with a different interface that provides a method <code>specific_request</code> which we want to adapt. The <code>Adapter</code> struct implements the <code>Target</code> trait and uses an instance of <code>Adaptee</code> internally. In the <code>request</code> method, the adapter translates the call to <code>specific_request</code> of <code>Adaptee</code>, thereby adapting its interface to the one expected by clients. In the <code>main</code> function, an instance of <code>Adaptee</code> is created and used through the <code>Adapter</code>, demonstrating how the Adapter pattern facilitates the integration of incompatible interfaces.
</p>

### 6.3.2. Bridge
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Bridge pattern separates abstraction from implementation, allowing them to vary independently without affecting each other. This pattern is useful when you want to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that both can evolve separately. In Rust, the Bridge pattern can be implemented by defining an abstraction trait and an implementation trait, then creating concrete types for both the abstraction and the implementation. Hereâ€™s an example of the Bridge pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Implementor {
    fn operation_impl(&self) -> String;
}

struct ConcreteImplementorA;
struct ConcreteImplementorB;

impl Implementor for ConcreteImplementorA {
    fn operation_impl(&self) -> String {
        "Implementation A".to_string()
    }
}

impl Implementor for ConcreteImplementorB {
    fn operation_impl(&self) -> String {
        "Implementation B".to_string()
    }
}

trait Abstraction {
    fn operation(&self) -> String;
}

struct RefinedAbstraction {
    implementor: Box<dyn Implementor>,
}

impl Abstraction for RefinedAbstraction {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        format!("Abstraction with {}", self.implementor.operation_impl())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let implementor_a = ConcreteImplementorA;
    let implementor_b = ConcreteImplementorB;
    
    let abstraction_a = RefinedAbstraction {
        implementor: Box::new(implementor_a),
    };
    
    let abstraction_b = RefinedAbstraction {
        implementor: Box::new(implementor_b),
    };
    
    println!("{}", abstraction_a.operation());
    println!("{}", abstraction_b.operation());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Implementor</code> trait defines the interface for the implementation part, with <code>operation_impl</code> as its method. <code>ConcreteImplementorA</code> and <code>ConcreteImplementorB</code> are concrete implementations of this trait, each providing a different behavior. The <code>Abstraction</code> trait defines the interface for the abstraction part, and <code>RefinedAbstraction</code> is a concrete type that holds a reference to an <code>Implementor</code> and uses it to perform its operations. The <code>operation</code> method of <code>RefinedAbstraction</code> delegates the actual work to the <code>Implementor</code>'s <code>operation_impl</code> method, thus bridging the gap between the abstraction and its implementation. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of both <code>ConcreteImplementorA</code> and <code>ConcreteImplementorB</code> are used with <code>RefinedAbstraction</code> to demonstrate how the Bridge pattern allows for flexible and independent evolution of both the abstraction and implementation layers.
</p>

### 6.3.3. Composite
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Composite pattern is designed to allow individual objects and compositions of objects to be treated uniformly, typically to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern enables clients to interact with individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way, making it easier to work with tree-like structures where both leaf nodes and composite nodes are handled consistently. In Rust, the Composite pattern is implemented by defining a component trait for both leaf and composite nodes, with concrete types for each. Hereâ€™s an example of the Composite pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Component {
    fn operation(&self) -> String;
}

struct Leaf {
    name: String,
}

impl Component for Leaf {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        format!("Leaf: {}", self.name)
    }
}

struct Composite {
    children: Vec<Box<dyn Component>>,
}

impl Component for Composite {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        let mut result = "Composite:\n".to_string();
        for child in &self.children {
            result.push_str(&child.operation());
            result.push_str("\n");
        }
        result
    }
}

fn main() {
    let leaf1 = Box::new(Leaf { name: "Leaf 1".to_string() });
    let leaf2 = Box::new(Leaf { name: "Leaf 2".to_string() });
    
    let mut composite = Composite { children: Vec::new() };
    composite.children.push(leaf1);
    composite.children.push(leaf2);
    
    println!("{}", composite.operation());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Component</code> trait defines a common interface for both leaf and composite nodes, with the <code>operation</code> method. The <code>Leaf</code> struct represents a leaf node in the hierarchy, providing its specific implementation of <code>operation</code>. The <code>Composite</code> struct represents a composite node that holds a collection of child components (which can be either <code>Leaf</code> or <code>Composite</code>). Its implementation of <code>operation</code> iterates over its children and accumulates their results. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>Leaf</code> are created and added to a <code>Composite</code>, demonstrating how the Composite pattern allows for flexible management and interaction with hierarchical structures by treating both leaf and composite nodes uniformly.
</p>

### 6.3.4. Decorator
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Decorator pattern allows for the dynamic addition of responsibilities to objects without altering their structure, by wrapping them with additional functionality. This pattern is useful for extending the behavior of objects in a flexible and reusable way. In Rust, the Decorator pattern is implemented by defining a base trait for the core functionality and creating decorator structs that also implement this trait, adding their own behavior before or after delegating to the original object. Hereâ€™s an example of the Decorator pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Coffee {
    fn cost(&self) -> f64;
}

struct SimpleCoffee;

impl Coffee for SimpleCoffee {
    fn cost(&self) -> f64 {
        5.0
    }
}

struct MilkDecorator {
    coffee: Box<dyn Coffee>,
}

impl Coffee for MilkDecorator {
    fn cost(&self) -> f64 {
        self.coffee.cost() + 1.0
    }
}

struct SugarDecorator {
    coffee: Box<dyn Coffee>,
}

impl Coffee for SugarDecorator {
    fn cost(&self) -> f64 {
        self.coffee.cost() + 0.5
    }
}

fn main() {
    let simple_coffee = Box::new(SimpleCoffee);
    let milk_coffee = MilkDecorator {
        coffee: simple_coffee,
    };
    let sugar_milk_coffee = SugarDecorator {
        coffee: Box::new(milk_coffee),
    };
    
    println!("Cost of simple coffee: ${}", simple_coffee.cost());
    println!("Cost of milk coffee: ${}", milk_coffee.cost());
    println!("Cost of sugar milk coffee: ${}", sugar_milk_coffee.cost());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Coffee</code> trait defines the core functionality with the <code>cost</code> method. <code>SimpleCoffee</code> is a concrete implementation of <code>Coffee</code>, representing a basic coffee. The <code>MilkDecorator</code> and <code>SugarDecorator</code> structs are decorators that enhance the behavior of the <code>Coffee</code> trait by adding costs for milk and sugar, respectively. Each decorator holds a reference to another <code>Coffee</code> instance, which it delegates to, adding its own cost to the result. In the <code>main</code> function, a <code>SimpleCoffee</code> instance is decorated first with <code>MilkDecorator</code> and then with <code>SugarDecorator</code>, demonstrating how the Decorator pattern allows for flexible composition of behaviors without altering the original <code>SimpleCoffee</code> implementation.

### 6.3.5. Facade
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with the subsystem without needing to understand its intricate details. This pattern is useful for reducing complexity by encapsulating multiple components and providing a unified interface for their operations. In Rust, the Facade pattern is implemented by creating a facade struct that internally manages the interactions with various subsystem components, offering a simplified interface to the client. Hereâ€™s an example of the Facade pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct SubsystemA;
struct SubsystemB;
struct SubsystemC;

impl SubsystemA {
    fn operation_a(&self) -> String {
        "SubsystemA: Operation A".to_string()
    }
}

impl SubsystemB {
    fn operation_b(&self) -> String {
        "SubsystemB: Operation B".to_string()
    }
}

impl SubsystemC {
    fn operation_c(&self) -> String {
        "SubsystemC: Operation C".to_string()
    }
}

struct Facade {
    subsystem_a: SubsystemA,
    subsystem_b: SubsystemB,
    subsystem_c: SubsystemC,
}

impl Facade {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Facade {
            subsystem_a: SubsystemA,
            subsystem_b: SubsystemB,
            subsystem_c: SubsystemC,
        }
    }

    fn unified_operation(&self) -> String {
        let mut result = String::new();
        result.push_str(&self.subsystem_a.operation_a());
        result.push_str("\n");
        result.push_str(&self.subsystem_b.operation_b());
        result.push_str("\n");
        result.push_str(&self.subsystem_c.operation_c());
        result
    }
}

fn main() {
    let facade = Facade::new();
    println!("{}", facade.unified_operation());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>SubsystemA</code>, <code>SubsystemB</code>, and <code>SubsystemC</code> represent complex subsystems with their respective operations. The <code>Facade</code> struct provides a simplified interface to these subsystems through its <code>unified_operation</code> method, which coordinates calls to the subsystems and aggregates their results. The <code>Facade</code> constructor initializes the subsystem components and offers a single entry point for client interactions. In the <code>main</code> function, an instance of <code>Facade</code> is created, and its <code>unified_operation</code> method is called to demonstrate how the Facade pattern simplifies interaction with the underlying subsystems, making the overall system easier to use and manage.
</p>

### 6.3.6. Flyweight
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Flyweight pattern is designed to efficiently support a large number of objects by sharing common state among them, thus reducing memory usage and improving performance. This pattern is particularly useful when objects share a significant amount of state, and only the unique aspects of each object need to be stored separately. In Rust, the Flyweight pattern can be implemented by defining a trait for the shared interface, creating concrete implementations that store shared state, and using a manager to handle the creation and reuse of these shared objects. Hereâ€™s an example of the Flyweight pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

trait Flyweight {
    fn operation(&self) -> String;
}

struct ConcreteFlyweight {
    shared_state: String,
}

impl Flyweight for ConcreteFlyweight {
    fn operation(&self) -> String {
        format!("ConcreteFlyweight with state: {}", self.shared_state)
    }
}

struct FlyweightFactory {
    flyweights: Mutex<HashMap<String, Arc<ConcreteFlyweight>>>,
}

impl FlyweightFactory {
    fn new() -> Self {
        FlyweightFactory {
            flyweights: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),
        }
    }

    fn get_flyweight(&self, state: &str) -> Arc<ConcreteFlyweight> {
        let mut flyweights = self.flyweights.lock().unwrap();
        if let Some(flyweight) = flyweights.get(state) {
            flyweight.clone()
        } else {
            let flyweight = Arc::new(ConcreteFlyweight {
                shared_state: state.to_string(),
            });
            flyweights.insert(state.to_string(), flyweight.clone());
            flyweight
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let factory = FlyweightFactory::new();
    
    let flyweight1 = factory.get_flyweight("State1");
    let flyweight2 = factory.get_flyweight("State2");
    let flyweight3 = factory.get_flyweight("State1");
    
    println!("{}", flyweight1.operation());
    println!("{}", flyweight2.operation());
    println!("{}", flyweight3.operation());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Flyweight</code> trait defines the common interface for flyweight objects, while <code>ConcreteFlyweight</code> represents a concrete implementation that stores shared state. The <code>FlyweightFactory</code> manages the creation and reuse of <code>ConcreteFlyweight</code> instances, using a <code>HashMap</code> to keep track of created instances and a <code>Mutex</code> to ensure thread safety. The <code>get_flyweight</code> method either retrieves an existing <code>ConcreteFlyweight</code> with the given state or creates a new one if it does not already exist. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>ConcreteFlyweight</code> are created and reused, demonstrating how the Flyweight pattern reduces memory usage by sharing instances with the same state, and showing the efficiency of managing a large number of objects with shared data.
</p>

### 6.3.7. Proxy
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it, often adding additional functionality such as lazy initialization, access control, or logging. This pattern is useful for managing the interaction with a resource-intensive object or for enforcing access rules. In Rust, the Proxy pattern is implemented by defining a trait for the common interface, creating a real subject that implements this trait, and a proxy struct that also implements the trait but controls access to the real subject. Hereâ€™s an example of the Proxy pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Subject {
    fn request(&self) -> String;
}

struct RealSubject;

impl Subject for RealSubject {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        "RealSubject: Handling request".to_string()
    }
}

struct Proxy {
    real_subject: Option<RealSubject>,
}

impl Proxy {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Proxy { real_subject: None }
    }

    fn load_real_subject(&mut self) {
        if self.real_subject.is_none() {
            println!("Loading RealSubject...");
            self.real_subject = Some(RealSubject);
        }
    }
}

impl Subject for Proxy {
    fn request(&self) -> String {
        let mut real_subject = self.real_subject.clone();
        if real_subject.is_none() {
            println!("RealSubject not yet loaded.");
            real_subject = Some(RealSubject);
        }
        real_subject.unwrap().request()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut proxy = Proxy::new();
    println!("{}", proxy.request());
    println!("{}", proxy.request());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Subject</code> trait defines the interface for both the real subject and its proxy. The <code>RealSubject</code> struct provides the actual implementation of the <code>request</code> method. The <code>Proxy</code> struct, which also implements the <code>Subject</code> trait, initially does not have a <code>RealSubject</code> instance. It includes a method <code>load_real_subject</code> to initialize <code>RealSubject</code> when needed. In the <code>request</code> method, the proxy checks if the real subject is loaded and initializes it if necessary, then delegates the request to the real subject. In the <code>main</code> function, a <code>Proxy</code> instance is created, demonstrating how the Proxy pattern delays the instantiation of <code>RealSubject</code> until it is actually needed and controls access to it, which can be particularly useful for managing resource-intensive objects or adding additional behavior.
</p>

## 6.4. Behavioral Patterns
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Behavioral design patterns focus on the interactions and responsibilities between objects, aiming to optimize the ways in which objects collaborate and communicate. These patterns address the complexity of object interactions by defining clear roles and responsibilities, thereby facilitating the management of dynamic and complex workflows. The primary purpose of behavioral patterns is to improve communication between objects, manage their interactions more effectively, and distribute responsibilities in a flexible manner.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s enums and pattern matching offer powerful tools for implementing behavioral patterns. Enums in Rust allow the definition of a type that can be one of several variants, which is particularly useful for representing various states or types of behavior in patterns like State or Strategy. Pattern matching facilitates the handling of different cases and transitions in a clean and concise manner, making it easier to implement complex behavioral logic. This combination of enums and pattern matching enhances the clarity and safety of implementing behavioral patterns, ensuring robust and maintainable code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Key behavioral patterns include the Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, and Template Method patterns. The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a chain of objects to handle a request, giving each object a chance to process it or pass it along. The Command pattern encapsulates requests as objects, enabling parameterization and queuing. The Iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. The Mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects, reducing their direct dependencies. The Memento pattern captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency where changes in one object notify and update others. The State pattern allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, and the Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, making them interchangeable. Finally, the Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to override specific steps without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure. Each of these patterns helps manage complex interactions and responsibilities, contributing to more modular and maintainable systems.
</p>

### 6.4.1. Chain of Responsibility
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers, where each handler has the opportunity to process the request or pass it along to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, enabling multiple objects to handle the request in a flexible and extensible manner. In Rust, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is implemented by defining a trait for handling requests, creating concrete handler structs that implement this trait, and setting up a chain of handlers where each handler can either process the request or delegate it to the next handler in the chain. Hereâ€™s an example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Handler {
    fn set_next(&mut self, next: Box<dyn Handler>);
    fn handle_request(&self, request: &str) -> Option<String>;
}

struct ConcreteHandlerA {
    next_handler: Option<Box<dyn Handler>>,
}

impl ConcreteHandlerA {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ConcreteHandlerA { next_handler: None }
    }
}

impl Handler for ConcreteHandlerA {
    fn set_next(&mut self, next: Box<dyn Handler>) {
        self.next_handler = Some(next);
    }

    fn handle_request(&self, request: &str) -> Option<String> {
        if request == "A" {
            Some("Handled by ConcreteHandlerA".to_string())
        } else {
            self.next_handler.as_ref()?.handle_request(request)
        }
    }
}

struct ConcreteHandlerB {
    next_handler: Option<Box<dyn Handler>>,
}

impl ConcreteHandlerB {
    fn new() -> Self {
        ConcreteHandlerB { next_handler: None }
    }
}

impl Handler for ConcreteHandlerB {
    fn set_next(&mut self, next: Box<dyn Handler>) {
        self.next_handler = Some(next);
    }

    fn handle_request(&self, request: &str) -> Option<String> {
        if request == "B" {
            Some("Handled by ConcreteHandlerB".to_string())
        } else {
            self.next_handler.as_ref()?.handle_request(request)
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut handler_a = ConcreteHandlerA::new();
    let mut handler_b = ConcreteHandlerB::new();

    handler_a.set_next(Box::new(handler_b));

    let request = "A";
    match handler_a.handle_request(request) {
        Some(response) => println!("{}", response),
        None => println!("Request not handled"),
    }

    let request = "B";
    match handler_a.handle_request(request) {
        Some(response) => println!("{}", response),
        None => println!("Request not handled"),
    }

    let request = "C";
    match handler_a.handle_request(request) {
        Some(response) => println!("{}", response),
        None => println!("Request not handled"),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Handler</code> trait defines the interface for handling requests, including methods for setting the next handler in the chain and processing the request. <code>ConcreteHandlerA</code> and <code>ConcreteHandlerB</code> are concrete implementations of the <code>Handler</code> trait, each capable of handling specific requests and delegating others to the next handler. The <code>set_next</code> method establishes the chain by linking handlers together. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>ConcreteHandlerA</code> and <code>ConcreteHandlerB</code> are created and linked, demonstrating how the Chain of Responsibility pattern allows requests to be processed by the appropriate handler in the chain or passed along if not handled.
</p>

### 6.4.2. Command
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. This pattern separates the responsibility of issuing a request from the responsibility of executing it, enabling features like undo functionality, logging, and transactional behavior. In Rust, the Command pattern is implemented by defining a command trait with an <code>execute</code> method, creating concrete command structs that implement this trait, and an invoker that holds and executes these commands. Hereâ€™s an example of the Command pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Command {
    fn execute(&self);
}

struct LightOnCommand;
struct LightOffCommand;

impl Command for LightOnCommand {
    fn execute(&self) {
        println!("The light is on.");
    }
}

impl Command for LightOffCommand {
    fn execute(&self) {
        println!("The light is off.");
    }
}

struct RemoteControl {
    command: Box<dyn Command>,
}

impl RemoteControl {
    fn new(command: Box<dyn Command>) -> Self {
        RemoteControl { command }
    }

    fn press_button(&self) {
        self.command.execute();
    }
}

fn main() {
    let light_on = Box::new(LightOnCommand);
    let light_off = Box::new(LightOffCommand);

    let remote_on = RemoteControl::new(light_on);
    let remote_off = RemoteControl::new(light_off);

    remote_on.press_button();
    remote_off.press_button();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Command</code> trait defines the interface for command objects with an <code>execute</code> method. <code>LightOnCommand</code> and <code>LightOffCommand</code> are concrete implementations of this trait that encapsulate the operations to turn a light on or off. The <code>RemoteControl</code> struct acts as the invoker, holding a reference to a <code>Command</code> object and providing a method <code>press_button</code> to execute it. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>LightOnCommand</code> and <code>LightOffCommand</code> are created, wrapped in <code>Box</code> to satisfy Rustâ€™s trait object requirements, and passed to <code>RemoteControl</code> instances. The <code>press_button</code> method is then called to execute the commands, demonstrating how the Command pattern decouples command issuance from execution, allowing flexible and reusable command handling.
</p>

### 6.4.3. Iterator
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is especially useful for traversing complex data structures or collections in a uniform manner. In Rust, the Iterator pattern is implemented through the use of iterators, which are objects that implement the <code>Iterator</code> trait with methods like <code>next</code> to retrieve elements one by one. The <code>Iterator</code> trait is typically used with Rust's collections to enable easy and idiomatic iteration over elements. Hereâ€™s an example of the Iterator pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct MyCollection {
    items: Vec<i32>,
}

impl MyCollection {
    fn new() -> Self {
        MyCollection { items: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add(&mut self, item: i32) {
        self.items.push(item);
    }
}

impl IntoIterator for MyCollection {
    type Item = i32;
    type IntoIter = std::vec::IntoIter<i32>;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter {
        self.items.into_iter()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut collection = MyCollection::new();
    collection.add(1);
    collection.add(2);
    collection.add(3);

    for item in collection {
        println!("{}", item);
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>MyCollection</code> is a custom collection that holds a <code>Vec<i32></code>. The <code>IntoIterator</code> trait is implemented for <code>MyCollection</code>, which defines the associated <code>Item</code> type as <code>i32</code> and the <code>IntoIter</code> type as <code>std::vec::IntoIter<i32></code>. The <code>into_iter</code> method converts <code>MyCollection</code> into an iterator that iterates over its <code>items</code>. In the <code>main</code> function, a <code>MyCollection</code> instance is created, populated with integers, and then iterated over using a <code>for</code> loop. This demonstrates the Iterator pattern by abstracting the process of traversing the collection, allowing external code to access elements sequentially without needing to know about the internal structure of <code>MyCollection</code>.
</p>

### 6.4.4. Mediator
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly. This pattern centralizes communication between objects, allowing them to exchange information indirectly through the mediator, thus simplifying interactions and enhancing flexibility. In Rust, the Mediator pattern is implemented by defining a mediator trait with methods for communication, creating concrete mediator structs that implement this trait, and having components interact with each other through the mediator rather than directly. Hereâ€™s an example of the Mediator pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Mediator {
    fn notify(&self, sender: &str, event: &str);
}

struct ConcreteMediator {
    component1: Box<dyn Component>,
    component2: Box<dyn Component>,
}

impl ConcreteMediator {
    fn new(component1: Box<dyn Component>, component2: Box<dyn Component>) -> Self {
        ConcreteMediator { component1, component2 }
    }
}

impl Mediator for ConcreteMediator {
    fn notify(&self, sender: &str, event: &str) {
        match (sender, event) {
            ("Component1", "eventA") => {
                println!("Mediator reacts on eventA and triggers Component2");
                self.component2.handle_event("eventB");
            }
            ("Component2", "eventB") => {
                println!("Mediator reacts on eventB and triggers Component1");
                self.component1.handle_event("eventA");
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }
}

trait Component {
    fn handle_event(&self, event: &str);
}

struct Component1<'a> {
    mediator: &'a dyn Mediator,
}

impl<'a> Component1<'a> {
    fn new(mediator: &'a dyn Mediator) -> Self {
        Component1 { mediator }
    }
}

impl<'a> Component for Component1<'a> {
    fn handle_event(&self, event: &str) {
        println!("Component1 handles {}", event);
        self.mediator.notify("Component1", event);
    }
}

struct Component2<'a> {
    mediator: &'a dyn Mediator,
}

impl<'a> Component2<'a> {
    fn new(mediator: &'a dyn Mediator) -> Self {
        Component2 { mediator }
    }
}

impl<'a> Component for Component2<'a> {
    fn handle_event(&self, event: &str) {
        println!("Component2 handles {}", event);
        self.mediator.notify("Component2", event);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut mediator = ConcreteMediator::new(
        Box::new(Component1::new(&mediator)),
        Box::new(Component2::new(&mediator))
    );

    mediator.component1.handle_event("eventA");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Mediator</code> trait defines the interface for the mediator with a <code>notify</code> method to handle communication between components. <code>ConcreteMediator</code> is a specific implementation of this trait that manages interactions between <code>Component1</code> and <code>Component2</code>. Each component holds a reference to the mediator and uses it to notify the mediator about events. When a component handles an event, it triggers the mediator to notify other components based on predefined rules. The <code>main</code> function demonstrates this pattern by creating instances of components and a mediator, then initiating communication through the mediator, showcasing how the Mediator pattern centralizes and simplifies interactions among components.
</p>

### 6.4.5. Memento
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Memento pattern is used to capture and externalize an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing undo functionality or saving the state of an object at specific points in time. In Rust, the Memento pattern is implemented by creating a memento struct to hold the state, a caretaker to manage the memento, and an originator that creates and restores the memento. Hereâ€™s an example of the Memento pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Memento {
    state: String,
}

impl Memento {
    fn new(state: String) -> Self {
        Memento { state }
    }

    fn get_state(&self) -> &str {
        &self.state
    }
}

struct Originator {
    state: String,
}

impl Originator {
    fn new(state: String) -> Self {
        Originator { state }
    }

    fn create_memento(&self) -> Memento {
        Memento::new(self.state.clone())
    }

    fn restore_from_memento(&mut self, memento: Memento) {
        self.state = memento.get_state().to_string();
    }

    fn get_state(&self) -> &str {
        &self.state
    }
}

struct Caretaker {
    memento: Option<Memento>,
}

impl Caretaker {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Caretaker { memento: None }
    }

    fn save(&mut self, memento: Memento) {
        self.memento = Some(memento);
    }

    fn restore(&self) -> Option<Memento> {
        self.memento.clone()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut originator = Originator::new("State1".to_string());
    let mut caretaker = Caretaker::new();

    println!("Current State: {}", originator.get_state());

    caretaker.save(originator.create_memento());

    originator.state = "State2".to_string();
    println!("Updated State: {}", originator.get_state());

    if let Some(memento) = caretaker.restore() {
        originator.restore_from_memento(memento);
        println!("Restored State: {}", originator.get_state());
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Memento</code> is a struct that stores the state of the <code>Originator</code>. The <code>Originator</code> struct can create a memento of its current state using the <code>create_memento</code> method and restore its state from a memento using the <code>restore_from_memento</code> method. <code>Caretaker</code> manages the memento, allowing it to save and restore the state. The <code>main</code> function demonstrates how the <code>Originator</code> can change its state, save this state via <code>Caretaker</code>, and then restore it later. This example illustrates the Memento pattern by showing how an objectâ€™s state can be preserved and restored without exposing its internal details, enabling features such as undo functionality.
</p>

### 6.4.6. Observer
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where a change in one object (the subject) automatically updates all dependent objects (observers) without the subject needing to know who or how many observers are involved. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event-handling systems, where multiple parts of a program need to respond to changes in state. In Rust, the Observer pattern can be implemented using traits and structs to represent subjects and observers. Hereâ€™s an example of the Observer pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Observer {
    fn update(&self, message: &str);
}

struct Subject {
    observers: Vec<Box<dyn Observer>>,
    state: String,
}

impl Subject {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Subject {
            observers: Vec::new(),
            state: String::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_observer(&mut self, observer: Box<dyn Observer>) {
        self.observers.push(observer);
    }

    fn set_state(&mut self, state: String) {
        self.state = state;
        self.notify_observers();
    }

    fn notify_observers(&self) {
        for observer in &self.observers {
            observer.update(&self.state);
        }
    }
}

struct ConcreteObserver {
    name: String,
}

impl Observer for ConcreteObserver {
    fn update(&self, message: &str) {
        println!("Observer {} received update: {}", self.name, message);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut subject = Subject::new();

    let observer1 = Box::new(ConcreteObserver { name: "Observer1".to_string() });
    let observer2 = Box::new(ConcreteObserver { name: "Observer2".to_string() });

    subject.add_observer(observer1);
    subject.add_observer(observer2);

    subject.set_state("New State".to_string());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, <code>Observer</code> is a trait that defines the <code>update</code> method, which observers must implement to handle state changes. The <code>Subject</code> struct maintains a list of observers and notifies them whenever its state changes by calling <code>notify_observers</code>. The <code>ConcreteObserver</code> struct implements the <code>Observer</code> trait and defines how it reacts to state updates. In the <code>main</code> function, two <code>ConcreteObserver</code> instances are created and registered with a <code>Subject</code>. When the state of the <code>Subject</code> is changed using <code>set_state</code>, all registered observers are notified of the new state through their <code>update</code> method. This example demonstrates the Observer pattern by showing how multiple observers can respond to changes in a subject, facilitating a decoupled and flexible event-handling mechanism.
</p>

### 6.4.7. State
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, effectively enabling it to appear as if it has changed its class. This pattern is useful for managing state-dependent behavior in an object without resorting to complex conditional statements. In Rust, the State pattern is typically implemented by defining a set of state structs that implement a common trait, and having a context struct that holds a reference to the current state. Hereâ€™s an example of the State pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait State {
    fn handle(&self);
}

struct Context {
    state: Box<dyn State>,
}

impl Context {
    fn new(state: Box<dyn State>) -> Self {
        Context { state }
    }

    fn set_state(&mut self, state: Box<dyn State>) {
        self.state = state;
    }

    fn request(&self) {
        self.state.handle();
    }
}

struct ConcreteStateA;

impl State for ConcreteStateA {
    fn handle(&self) {
        println!("Handling state A");
    }
}

struct ConcreteStateB;

impl State for ConcreteStateB {
    fn handle(&self) {
        println!("Handling state B");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let state_a = Box::new(ConcreteStateA);
    let state_b = Box::new(ConcreteStateB);

    let mut context = Context::new(state_a);

    context.request();
    
    context.set_state(state_b);
    context.request();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>State</code> trait defines a <code>handle</code> method that different states must implement. The <code>Context</code> struct contains a <code>Box<dyn State></code> to hold the current state and has methods to change states and request handling. <code>ConcreteStateA</code> and <code>ConcreteStateB</code> are specific implementations of the <code>State</code> trait, each providing its own behavior for the <code>handle</code> method. In the <code>main</code> function, a <code>Context</code> object is initially set with <code>ConcreteStateA</code>. When <code>request</code> is called, the behavior corresponding to <code>ConcreteStateA</code> is executed. The state is then changed to <code>ConcreteStateB</code>, and calling <code>request</code> again triggers the behavior of <code>ConcreteStateB</code>. This example illustrates the State pattern by showing how the <code>Context</code> object delegates its behavior to its current state, enabling dynamic changes in behavior based on state transitions.
</p>

### 6.4.8. Strategy
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. This pattern is useful for choosing an algorithm's behavior at runtime, providing flexibility to select and switch strategies without altering the client code. In Rust, the Strategy pattern is implemented by creating a trait for the strategy and different structs that implement this trait, with the context struct using a trait object to delegate strategy-specific operations. Hereâ€™s an example of the Strategy pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait Strategy {
    fn execute(&self, data: &str);
}

struct Context {
    strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>,
}

impl Context {
    fn new(strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>) -> Self {
        Context { strategy }
    }

    fn set_strategy(&mut self, strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>) {
        self.strategy = strategy;
    }

    fn do_work(&self, data: &str) {
        self.strategy.execute(data);
    }
}

struct ConcreteStrategyA;

impl Strategy for ConcreteStrategyA {
    fn execute(&self, data: &str) {
        println!("ConcreteStrategyA processing: {}", data);
    }
}

struct ConcreteStrategyB;

impl Strategy for ConcreteStrategyB {
    fn execute(&self, data: &str) {
        println!("ConcreteStrategyB processing: {}", data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let strategy_a = Box::new(ConcreteStrategyA);
    let strategy_b = Box::new(ConcreteStrategyB);

    let mut context = Context::new(strategy_a);

    context.do_work("Task 1");

    context.set_strategy(strategy_b);
    context.do_work("Task 2");
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>Strategy</code> trait defines a common interface with the <code>execute</code> method that different strategies implement. The <code>Context</code> struct holds a reference to a <code>Box<dyn Strategy></code>, allowing it to use any strategy that conforms to the <code>Strategy</code> trait. <code>ConcreteStrategyA</code> and <code>ConcreteStrategyB</code> are implementations of the <code>Strategy</code> trait, each providing its own version of the <code>execute</code> method. In the <code>main</code> function, a <code>Context</code> is initialized with <code>ConcreteStrategyA</code>, and its <code>do_work</code> method executes the behavior defined by this strategy. The strategy is then switched to <code>ConcreteStrategyB</code>, and the <code>do_work</code> method is called again, demonstrating how the behavior can be dynamically changed based on the strategy used. This example shows how the Strategy pattern enables flexible and interchangeable algorithms within a client context.
</p>

### 6.4.9. Template Method
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern allows you to implement invariant parts of an algorithm once in the base class while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain steps. In Rust, this pattern can be implemented using traits and structs, where a base trait defines the template method and the steps, and concrete structs implement the specific steps. Hereâ€™s an example of the Template Method pattern in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
trait TemplateMethod {
    fn template_method(&self) {
        self.step1();
        self.step2();
        self.step3();
    }

    fn step1(&self);
    fn step2(&self);
    fn step3(&self);
}

struct ConcreteClassA;

impl TemplateMethod for ConcreteClassA {
    fn step1(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassA Step 1");
    }

    fn step2(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassA Step 2");
    }

    fn step3(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassA Step 3");
    }
}

struct ConcreteClassB;

impl TemplateMethod for ConcreteClassB {
    fn step1(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassB Step 1");
    }

    fn step2(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassB Step 2");
    }

    fn step3(&self) {
        println!("ConcreteClassB Step 3");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let class_a = ConcreteClassA;
    let class_b = ConcreteClassB;

    println!("Class A:");
    class_a.template_method();

    println!("\nClass B:");
    class_b.template_method();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code, the <code>TemplateMethod</code> trait defines the <code>template_method</code>, which outlines the sequence of steps (<code>step1</code>, <code>step2</code>, and <code>step3</code>) for the algorithm. The <code>ConcreteClassA</code> and <code>ConcreteClassB</code> structs implement the <code>TemplateMethod</code> trait, providing specific behaviors for each step of the algorithm. The <code>template_method</code> is defined in the trait and calls the steps in a fixed order, while the actual implementation of each step is provided by the concrete classes. In the <code>main</code> function, instances of <code>ConcreteClassA</code> and <code>ConcreteClassB</code> are created, and their <code>template_method</code> is called to execute the algorithm with different implementations. This example illustrates how the Template Method pattern allows for the definition of an algorithm's structure while permitting flexibility in the specific steps through subclass implementations.
</p>

## 6.5. Applying GOF in Rust
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Applying Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Rust involves leveraging the patterns' general principles while adapting them to Rustâ€™s unique language features. Rust's distinct characteristics, such as its ownership model, strict type system, and concurrency features, provide a different context for implementing these patterns compared to traditional object-oriented languages. Understanding how to align GoF patterns with Rustâ€™s paradigms can significantly enhance the effectiveness of design solutions within Rust projects.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One of the core principles of applying GoF patterns in Rust is adapting their structural and behavioral approaches to fit within the constraints of Rustâ€™s ownership and borrowing system. For instance, the Singleton pattern, which ensures a single instance of a class, can be implemented using Rust's <code>static</code> variables combined with synchronization primitives such as <code>Mutex</code> or <code>RwLock</code>. Rustâ€™s ownership model ensures that such singletons are accessed safely across threads, respecting the borrow checkerâ€™s constraints and preventing data races. Similarly, the Factory Method and Abstract Factory patterns can be adapted to utilize Rustâ€™s enums and traits, which allow for flexible object creation and type abstraction while maintaining safety and avoiding the pitfalls of traditional inheritance hierarchies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The relevance of GoF patterns in modern Rust applications is particularly pronounced when considering Rustâ€™s emphasis on safety and concurrency. For example, the Observer pattern, which allows objects to notify others about changes, can benefit from Rustâ€™s message-passing concurrency model. Channels and asynchronous tasks facilitate efficient and safe communication between objects, aligning well with the pattern's intent to manage notifications and updates. The Strategy pattern, which defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable, can be implemented using Rustâ€™s traits and enums, allowing for polymorphic behavior while ensuring type safety. Moreover, patterns like the Iterator, Command, and State can be effectively employed to manage complex workflows and state transitions in a way that leverages Rustâ€™s strong type system and pattern matching capabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, applying GoF patterns in Rust involves adapting their core concepts to work harmoniously with Rustâ€™s unique features, such as its ownership model, concurrency mechanisms, and type safety guarantees. By doing so, Rust programmers can implement robust, efficient, and maintainable designs that take full advantage of Rust's strengths while adhering to the timeless principles of the GoF patterns. This adaptation not only preserves the patternsâ€™ intended benefits but also enhances their applicability in modern software development contexts, ensuring that Rust projects remain effective and reliable.
</p>

### 6.5.1. Case Studies and Examples
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Exploring case studies and practical examples where Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns have been effectively utilized in Rust projects provides valuable insights into how these patterns can be adapted to the language's unique features and constraints. Rust's emphasis on safety, concurrency, and performance makes it a compelling environment for applying GoF patterns, with several real-world examples showcasing their successful integration into Rust-based systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One notable example is the use of the Singleton pattern in Rust's standard libraries and other high-performance applications. In Rust, the Singleton pattern ensures that a particular resource or configuration is instantiated only once throughout the applicationâ€™s lifecycle. This is particularly useful in cases where a single point of configuration or shared resource needs to be accessed across various components without duplication. Rust's concurrency features, such as the <code>Mutex</code> or <code>RwLock</code>, provide safe and synchronized access to the singleton instance, addressing potential data races and ensuring thread-safe operations. This approach is exemplified in scenarios where a global configuration manager or logging service needs to be accessed by multiple threads concurrently, showcasing how the Singleton pattern can be effectively utilized while leveraging Rustâ€™s concurrency primitives to maintain safety and performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another relevant example is the implementation of the Strategy pattern in Rustâ€™s ecosystem, particularly in scenarios involving complex algorithmic choices or data processing tasks. Rustâ€™s traits are ideal for defining a family of interchangeable algorithms or behaviors. By leveraging traits, developers can define a set of operations that can be implemented differently depending on the context. This approach is used in various libraries and tools, where different strategies for data serialization, network communication, or mathematical computations can be employed based on runtime conditions or user preferences. The flexibility provided by traits and enums enables efficient and type-safe selection of strategies, facilitating clear and maintainable code that adapts to varying requirements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the realm of concurrent and parallel programming, the Observer pattern has found practical application in Rust projects. This pattern is used to implement publish-subscribe mechanisms where changes in one component need to be observed and acted upon by others. Rustâ€™s channels and asynchronous tasks are well-suited for this pattern, enabling components to communicate and synchronize without tightly coupling them. For instance, in a real-time data processing application, the Observer pattern allows different modules to react to incoming data or state changes, with Rustâ€™s channels facilitating safe and efficient message passing between components. This implementation not only adheres to the Observer pattern's principles but also takes advantage of Rust's robust concurrency features to handle complex, real-time interactions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, the Builder pattern has been effectively used in Rust to manage the construction of complex objects with a flexible and controlled approach. Rustâ€™s ability to define builder structs and methods allows for constructing objects step-by-step, ensuring that all required components are correctly initialized before finalization. This pattern is particularly beneficial in scenarios where objects have multiple configuration options or where construction involves several stages. By using the Builder pattern, Rust developers can maintain clear and readable code while ensuring that the object creation process is both flexible and robust.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These case studies illustrate how GoF patterns can be adapted to Rustâ€™s unique programming model, leveraging its features to address design challenges effectively. By integrating these patterns, Rust projects benefit from enhanced flexibility, maintainability, and safety, demonstrating the enduring relevance and adaptability of GoF design principles in modern software development contexts.
</p>

### 6.5.2. Simple Calculator Program
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Lets reimplement the simple calculator program in Chapter 5.9.1 using the Gang of Four (GOF) design patterns. We utilize several classic patterns such as <strong>Factory Method</strong>, <strong>Composite</strong>, <strong>Interpreter</strong>, and <strong>Visitor</strong> to ensure quality, maintainability, and extensibility. These patterns will help structure the program in a modular and scalable way, adhering to well-established object-oriented design principles.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this implementation, we incorporate several GOF design patterns to structure the calculator's components effectively.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Composite Pattern:</strong> The <code>Expression</code> trait defines the interface for all expression components in the AST. The <code>Number</code> and <code>BinaryOperation</code> structs implement this trait, representing different kinds of nodes. The <code>Number</code> struct holds a simple numeric value, while the <code>BinaryOperation</code> struct represents operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These components are used to build the AST, with <code>BinaryOperation</code> nodes acting as internal nodes and <code>Number</code> nodes as leaves.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Visitor Pattern:</strong> The <code>Visitor</code> trait defines methods for visiting different types of nodes in the AST. The <code>Evaluator</code> struct implements this trait, providing the logic to evaluate the expression. The <code>visit_number</code> method simply returns the value of a <code>Number</code> node, while the <code>visit_binary_operation</code> method recursively evaluates the left and right operands of a <code>BinaryOperation</code> and applies the specified operator. This pattern separates the algorithm of traversing the AST from the structure of the AST itself, enabling new operations on the AST without modifying its classes.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Factory Method Pattern:</strong> The <code>Parser</code> struct acts as a factory for creating expression nodes. It constructs the AST by parsing the input tokens into expressions, terms, and factors. The <code>parse</code> method initiates this process, while <code>parse_expression</code>, <code>parse_term</code>, and <code>parse_factor</code> methods handle specific levels of parsing. This pattern allows for the creation of different types of <code>Expression</code> objects based on the tokens encountered, facilitating the extension of the calculator's capabilities by adding new expression types.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In the <strong>main function</strong>, we demonstrate the complete process of tokenizing the input, parsing it into an AST, and evaluating the result. The input string is passed to the <code>Tokenizer</code>, which breaks it down into tokens. The <code>Parser</code> then constructs the AST from these tokens, and the <code>Evaluator</code> traverses the AST to compute the result.</p>

### 6.6.1. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Implementing Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Rust requires a deep understanding of Rust's unique features, such as ownership, borrowing, and its trait-based system, to ensure that the patterns are used effectively while preventing bad code and code smells.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">For patterns such as the Singleton, Rustâ€™s ownership model is crucial. To implement the Singleton pattern, you need to ensure that the singleton instance is both globally accessible and unique. Rustâ€™s <code>lazy_static</code> crate or the <code>OnceCell</code> type can help achieve this by providing a safe and efficient way to create a single instance of a type while ensuring thread safety. It's important to handle mutable access carefully to avoid issues like race conditions and ensure that the singleton instance remains immutable or properly synchronized.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">When applying the Factory Method pattern, Rust's trait system is indispensable. Traits allow you to define a common interface for creating objects while deferring the instantiation to subclasses or implementations. This approach helps in maintaining type safety and avoiding code smells related to hardcoded object creation. Rustâ€™s type system ensures that all possible implementations are known at compile-time, reducing the risks of runtime errors and enhancing code clarity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Adapter pattern can be effectively implemented in Rust by using traits to create a unified interface that adapts disparate interfaces. This is particularly useful when integrating with third-party libraries or legacy code. Rustâ€™s enums and pattern matching can help manage different adapter states, ensuring that each state is handled correctly and reducing the complexity often associated with traditional adapter implementations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For the Composite pattern, Rust's enum types are a powerful tool for managing hierarchical structures. Enums can represent various component types and their relationships, while pattern matching can simplify operations on these components. This approach helps in avoiding code smells related to excessive complexity or poor encapsulation, as each component type is clearly defined and managed.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Observer pattern in Rust benefits from the languageâ€™s concurrency features, such as channels and async/await. Channels can be used to implement event notification systems where observers subscribe to updates from a subject. It's crucial to manage the lifetimes and ownership of both observers and subjects to avoid issues like dangling references or memory leaks, ensuring that the pattern remains efficient and maintainable.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rustâ€™s trait objects and dynamic dispatch are useful for implementing the Strategy pattern, which involves encapsulating algorithms or behaviors within interchangeable strategies. By using traits, you can define a common interface for different strategies, allowing you to switch strategies dynamically. This ensures that the pattern remains flexible and reduces the risk of code smells related to rigid or hardcoded behavior.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In implementing the Prototype pattern, Rustâ€™s ownership and cloning capabilities come into play. Rustâ€™s <code>Clone</code> trait allows for the duplication of objects, but careful management is needed to handle ownership and borrowing correctly. Itâ€™s important to ensure that cloning does not lead to performance issues or unintended side effects, such as shallow copies of complex data structures.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rustâ€™s enum types and pattern matching are also beneficial for implementing the State pattern, where an objectâ€™s behavior changes based on its internal state. Enums can represent different states and their transitions, while pattern matching simplifies state management and transitions. This approach helps in avoiding code smells related to excessive conditional logic or state-related bugs.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For the Decorator pattern, Rustâ€™s ownership model and trait system facilitate the enhancement of object behavior dynamically. By using traits to define additional functionalities and wrapping objects with new implementations, you can extend behavior without altering the original object. Itâ€™s essential to manage the complexity of decorator chains and ensure that each decorator maintains the expected interface and performance characteristics.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In implementing the Bridge pattern, Rustâ€™s trait objects can be used to separate abstraction from implementation. By defining traits for abstraction and concrete types for implementation, you can achieve flexibility and scalability while avoiding code smells related to tightly coupled components or excessive complexity.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">When applying the Flyweight pattern, Rustâ€™s smart pointers like <code>Rc</code> and <code>Arc</code> help manage shared data efficiently. By using reference counting, you can reduce memory usage and avoid duplication of shared components. Itâ€™s important to handle reference counting carefully to avoid issues such as reference cycles or performance degradation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Command pattern can be implemented in Rust using enums and traits to encapsulate requests as objects. This allows for flexible command execution and undo functionality. Managing command lifetimes and ensuring that commands are properly executed or reverted is crucial to avoid code smells related to command handling and execution.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rustâ€™s concurrency model and its support for asynchronous programming are advantageous for implementing the Memento pattern. By managing state snapshots effectively, you can ensure that the pattern remains efficient and avoids issues related to synchronization and state consistency.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Mediator pattern benefits from Rustâ€™s modularity and communication capabilities. By defining a mediator trait and using it to manage interactions between components, you can reduce direct dependencies and simplify communication. Itâ€™s important to avoid introducing excessive complexity or creating bottlenecks in the mediator implementation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">For the Interpreter pattern, Rustâ€™s type system and pattern matching help in parsing and interpreting expressions. By using enums to represent grammar rules and traits for interpretation logic, you can maintain clarity and efficiency while avoiding code smells related to complex parsing logic.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Rustâ€™s async/await syntax can be utilized to implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern, where multiple handlers process requests asynchronously. Managing asynchronous tasks and ensuring proper request flow is crucial to prevent issues related to concurrency and request handling.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The Template Method pattern can be adapted to Rust by using traits to define template methods with customizable steps. This allows for flexible method implementations while ensuring that the overall algorithm remains consistent, avoiding code smells related to rigid or duplicated code.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In implementing the Builder pattern, Rustâ€™s type system and trait bounds enable the construction of complex objects with step-by-step configuration. By using builder traits and implementing validation checks, you can ensure that objects are constructed correctly and avoid issues related to invalid or incomplete configurations.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the Proxy pattern in Rust benefits from the use of smart pointers and trait objects to manage access to underlying objects. By implementing proxies that handle access control or additional functionality, you can enhance performance and maintain clean code, avoiding common issues such as proxy overhead or complexity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, applying GoF design patterns in Rust requires leveraging the languageâ€™s unique features to address common design challenges effectively. By understanding and utilizing Rustâ€™s ownership model, trait system, enums, and concurrency capabilities, you can implement these patterns in a way that maintains elegance, efficiency, and code quality.
