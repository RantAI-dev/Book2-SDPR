# 2.1. Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Code smells refer to certain patterns or characteristics in a codebase that suggest potential issues in the software's design and implementation. They are not necessarily errors or bugs; instead, they are indicative signs that the code may have underlying problems that could lead to difficulties in maintenance, scalability, or understanding. A code smell does not mean that something is definitively wrong, but it does suggest that the code requires further inspection and possibly refactoring. Common examples of code smells include duplicated code, overly complex methods, large classes, and poor use of data structures. These smells are typically subjective and context-dependent, requiring experience and a deep understanding of good design principles to identify.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Identifying and addressing code smells is crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase. Code smells, if left unaddressed, can accumulate and lead to technical debt, making the code increasingly difficult to modify and extend over time. This technical debt can significantly slow down development, as new features and bug fixes become harder to implement. Moreover, code smells can obscure the original intent of the code, leading to misunderstandings and potential errors when other developers try to work with it. By recognizing these smells early, developers can refactor and improve the code, enhancing its clarity, reducing complexity, and ensuring it adheres to best practices. This proactive approach not only preserves the quality of the codebase but also fosters a more efficient and productive development environment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Several factors can contribute to the failure of some developers to identify and address code smells. One common reason is a lack of experience or knowledge about what constitutes good design practices. Without a solid understanding of design principles, developers may not recognize when the code deviates from these standards. Another factor is the pressure of tight deadlines and resource constraints, which can lead developers to prioritize immediate functionality over long-term code quality. In such situations, quick fixes and workarounds might be employed, inadvertently introducing code smells. Additionally, a lack of proper code review processes can prevent the identification of code smells, as peer reviews are an essential mechanism for catching issues that an individual developer might overlook. Lastly, some developers might have a tolerance for certain smells or may not fully appreciate the long-term consequences of leaving them unaddressed, leading to a gradual accumulation of technical debt. Understanding and addressing these challenges is vital for cultivating a culture that prioritizes clean, maintainable code.
</p>

# 2.2. Categories of Code Smells
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Code smells can be broadly categorized based on their characteristics and the specific issues they indicate in a codebase. These categories help in identifying the nature and origin of the problems, making it easier to address them systematically. While there are numerous specific smells, they generally fall into three major categories: structural, behavioral, and organizational smells. Understanding these categories is crucial for diagnosing and remedying issues that can affect the quality, maintainability, and performance of software.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Structural smells</strong> pertain to the architecture and layout of the code. They often arise from poor design choices that compromise the structural integrity of the software. Examples of structural smells include duplicated code, long methods, and large classes. Duplicated code occurs when similar code segments are repeated throughout the codebase, leading to difficulties in maintenance since changes need to be replicated in multiple places. Long methods and large classes indicate an over-concentration of functionality, making the code harder to understand, test, and modify. Other structural smells include primitive obsession, where basic data types are overused instead of creating meaningful abstractions, and complex conditional logic, which can be hard to follow and maintain. These smells often necessitate refactoring strategies such as extracting methods or classes, simplifying complex conditionals, and eliminating code duplication.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Behavioral smells</strong> relate to how the code behaves or how its behavior is implemented. These smells often indicate issues with the interactions between different parts of the system. For instance, feature envy occurs when a method in one class heavily relies on the data or methods of another class, suggesting that the functionality might be misplaced. Another example is the misuse of switch statements, especially when they are used to differentiate between types or behaviors that could be better handled through polymorphism. Behavioral smells can also include unnecessary coupling between modules, where changes in one module require changes in another, indicating poor separation of concerns. Addressing these smells often involves rethinking the design to better encapsulate behavior, use inheritance or interfaces more effectively, and reduce interdependencies.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Organizational smells</strong> are related to the broader organization of the codebase and the development process. These smells often emerge from inadequate project management practices or flawed team structures. Examples include inconsistent naming conventions, poor modularization, and inadequate documentation. Inconsistent naming can make it difficult for developers to understand and navigate the codebase, while poor modularization can lead to monolithic designs that are hard to manage and scale. Lack of proper documentation can hinder knowledge transfer and make it difficult for new developers to get up to speed. Organizational smells may also manifest as inadequate testing, where insufficient or poorly designed tests fail to catch bugs or regressions. Addressing these issues typically involves implementing consistent coding standards, improving the modularization of the codebase, ensuring comprehensive documentation, and adopting robust testing practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, recognizing and categorizing code smells into structural, behavioral, and organizational types allows for a more targeted approach to improving code quality. Each category requires specific strategies and best practices to address, and a thorough understanding of these categories helps developers maintain a clean and efficient codebase.
</p>

# 2.3. Common Code Smells
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Common code smells encompass a variety of recurring issues that can undermine the quality and maintainability of a codebase. <strong>Duplicated code</strong> refers to the repetition of similar code blocks, which complicates maintenance and increases the risk of inconsistencies. <strong>Long methods</strong> and <strong>large classes</strong> signify an overaccumulation of responsibilities, making the code harder to understand, test, and modify, and often indicating a need for refactoring into smaller, more focused units. <strong>Feature envy</strong> occurs when a method in one class excessively uses the methods or data of another class, suggesting misplaced functionality that could benefit from redistribution. <strong>Data clumps</strong> involve groups of data that frequently appear together but are not encapsulated within their own class, leading to scattered and harder-to-maintain code. <strong>Primitive obsession</strong> is characterized by the overuse of basic data types rather than creating domain-specific types that can encapsulate behavior and validation. <strong>Switch statements</strong> used to handle different types or behaviors can be indicative of a missed opportunity to employ polymorphism, which provides a cleaner and more maintainable approach. Finally, the misuse of <strong>comments</strong> can signal poor code clarity; while comments should explain the "why" behind decisions, over-reliance on them can indicate that the code itself is not self-explanatory and may need refactoring for better readability. These smells serve as red flags, prompting developers to consider more robust design principles and practices to enhance the overall quality of the software.
</p>

## 2.3.1. Duplicated Code
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Duplicated code, also known as code duplication, is a common code smell that occurs when identical or similar code blocks are repeated across different parts of a codebase. This issue can lead to increased maintenance efforts, as any change to the duplicated logic must be replicated across all occurrences. Additionally, it can introduce inconsistencies if one instance is updated while others are not, potentially leading to subtle bugs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, this might manifest as multiple functions performing the same operations or similar logic being repeated in different modules. Consider the following example, where two different functions perform the same calculation for the area of a rectangle:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn area_of_rectangle(length: f32, width: f32) -> f32 {
    length * width
}

fn calculate_area(length: f32, width: f32) -> f32 {
    length * width
}

fn main() {
    let length = 5.0;
    let width = 3.0;

    let area1 = area_of_rectangle(length, width);
    let area2 = calculate_area(length, width);

    println!("The area of the rectangle using area_of_rectangle is: {}", area1);
    println!("The area of the rectangle using calculate_area is: {}", area2);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this code snippet, both <code>area_of_rectangle</code> and <code>calculate_area</code> functions are identical, performing the same calculation. This duplication is problematic because if the logic needs to changeâ€”say, to handle cases where the length or width cannot be negativeâ€”both functions must be updated, increasing the likelihood of mistakes or inconsistencies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A better approach would be to consolidate this logic into a single function that can be reused wherever needed. For example:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn area(length: f32, width: f32) -> f32 {
    length * width
}

fn some_other_function() {
    let area = area(5.0, 3.0);
    println!("Area: {}", area);
}

fn main() {
    some_other_function();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here, the <code>area</code> function encapsulates the calculation logic. Any part of the codebase that requires this functionality can call this function, ensuring that the logic is centralized and easier to maintain. If the calculation logic changes, it only needs to be updated in one place, reducing the risk of errors and ensuring consistency.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another example of duplicated code could occur when handling error scenarios. For instance:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn parse_number1(input: &str) -> Result<i32, String> {
    match input.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(num) => Ok(num),
        Err(_) => Err("Failed to parse number".to_string()),
    }
}

fn parse_number2(input: &str) -> Result<i32, String> {
    match input.parse::<i32>() {
        Ok(num) => Ok(num),
        Err(_) => Err("Failed to parse number".to_string()),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let input1 = "42";
    let input2 = "abc";

    match parse_number1(input1) {
        Ok(num) => println!("parse_number1 successfully parsed: {}", num),
        Err(e) => println!("parse_number1 error: {}", e),
    }

    match parse_number2(input2) {
        Ok(num) => println!("parse_number2 successfully parsed: {}", num),
        Err(e) => println!("parse_number2 error: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Both <code>parse_number1</code> and <code>parse_number2</code> functions handle parsing in the same way, including the error message. The duplication can be eliminated by creating a single function:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn parse_number(input: &str) -> Result<i32, String> {
    input.parse::<i32>().map_err(|_| "Failed to parse number".to_string())
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Now, the error handling logic is encapsulated in one place, making the code easier to modify and maintain. If the error message needs to change or additional logging needs to be added, it can be done in one function without having to search through the codebase for similar logic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Duplicated code not only complicates maintenance but can also obscure the intended functionality of a program, making it harder for other developers to understand and work with the code. By identifying and refactoring duplicated code into reusable components or functions, developers can enhance the modularity, clarity, and maintainability of their software. In Rust, this often means leveraging the language's strong type system, functional programming features, and module system to create well-encapsulated and reusable code units.
</p>

## 2.3.2. Long Method
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The long method code smell occurs when a function or method becomes excessively long and complex, containing too much logic within a single block of code. This can make the method difficult to understand, maintain, and test. In many cases, long methods arise from a lack of proper abstraction, where multiple responsibilities are handled in one place rather than being divided into smaller, more manageable components.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, a long method might look something like this:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Order {
    id: u32,
    total: f64,
    status: String,
}

struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    is_premium: bool,
}

fn fetch_order(order_id: u32) -> Option<Order> {
    // Mock implementation
    Some(Order {
        id: order_id,
        total: 100.0,
        status: "Pending".to_string(),
    })
}

fn fetch_customer(customer_id: u32) -> Option<Customer> {
    // Mock implementation
    Some(Customer {
        id: customer_id,
        is_premium: true,
    })
}

fn update_order_total(order_id: u32, total: f64) {
    // Mock implementation
    println!("Order {} updated with new total: {}", order_id, total);
}

fn notify_customer(customer_id: u32, message: &str) {
    // Mock implementation
    println!("Notified customer {}: {}", customer_id, message);
}

fn process_order(order_id: u32, customer_id: u32) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Fetch order details
    let order = match fetch_order(order_id) {
        Some(o) => o,
        None => return Err("Order not found".to_string()),
    };

    // Validate order status
    if order.status != "Pending" {
        return Err("Order cannot be processed".to_string());
    }

    // Fetch customer details
    let customer = match fetch_customer(customer_id) {
        Some(c) => c,
        None => return Err("Customer not found".to_string()),
    };

    // Calculate discounts
    let discount = if customer.is_premium {
        0.1 * order.total
    } else {
        0.0
    };

    // Apply discount
    let total = order.total - discount;

    // Update order total
    update_order_total(order_id, total);

    // Notify customer
    notify_customer(customer_id, "Your order has been processed");

    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    match process_order(1, 101) {
        Ok(()) => println!("Order processed successfully."),
        Err(e) => println!("Error processing order: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>process_order</code> function performs multiple tasks: fetching order details, validating the order status, fetching customer details, calculating discounts, applying discounts, updating the order total, and notifying the customer. This method does too much, making it difficult to understand and reason about. Each responsibility is interwoven, making the method harder to maintain and test. For instance, changes in discount calculation might affect unrelated parts, such as order validation or customer notification.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address the long method code smell, we can refactor the method into smaller, more focused functions. This improves readability, testability, and maintainability. Here's a refactored version:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Order {
    id: u32,
    total: f64,
    status: String,
}

struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    is_premium: bool,
}

fn fetch_order(order_id: u32) -> Option<Order> {
    // Mock implementation
    Some(Order {
        id: order_id,
        total: 100.0,
        status: "Pending".to_string(),
    })
}

fn fetch_customer(customer_id: u32) -> Option<Customer> {
    // Mock implementation
    Some(Customer {
        id: customer_id,
        is_premium: true,
    })
}

fn update_order_total(order_id: u32, total: f64) {
    // Mock implementation
    println!("Order {} updated with new total: {}", order_id, total);
}

fn notify_customer(customer_id: u32, message: &str) {
    // Mock implementation
    println!("Notified customer {}: {}", customer_id, message);
}

fn process_order(order_id: u32, customer_id: u32) -> Result<(), String> {
    let order = fetch_order_or_error(order_id)?;
    validate_order_status(&order)?;
    let customer = fetch_customer_or_error(customer_id)?;

    let total = calculate_total(&order, &customer);
    update_order_total(order_id, total);

    notify_customer(customer_id, "Your order has been processed");

    Ok(())
}

fn fetch_order_or_error(order_id: u32) -> Result<Order, String> {
    fetch_order(order_id).ok_or("Order not found".to_string())
}

fn validate_order_status(order: &Order) -> Result<(), String> {
    if order.status != "Pending" {
        Err("Order cannot be processed".to_string())
    } else {
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn fetch_customer_or_error(customer_id: u32) -> Result<Customer, String> {
    fetch_customer(customer_id).ok_or("Customer not found".to_string())
}

fn calculate_total(order: &Order, customer: &Customer) -> f64 {
    let discount = if customer.is_premium {
        0.1 * order.total
    } else {
        0.0
    };
    order.total - discount
}

fn main() {
    match process_order(1, 101) {
        Ok(()) => println!("Order processed successfully."),
        Err(e) => println!("Error processing order: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this refactored code, the <code>process_order</code> function now orchestrates the workflow but delegates specific responsibilities to smaller helper functions. The <code>fetch_order_or_error</code> and <code>fetch_customer_or_error</code> functions encapsulate error handling related to fetching data, making it clear and reusable. The <code>validate_order_status</code> function focuses solely on checking the order's status, isolating validation logic. The <code>calculate_total</code> function handles discount calculation and final total computation, separating business logic related to pricing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By breaking down the <code>process_order</code> function, we achieve several benefits:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> Each function is short and focused, making the overall logic easier to follow.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhanced Maintainability:</strong> Changes to one part of the logic, such as discount calculation, can be made in isolation without affecting other parts of the process.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better Testability:</strong> Smaller functions are easier to test individually, allowing for more targeted and comprehensive testing.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> By separating concerns, the cognitive load required to understand the code is significantly reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Long methods are a common sign of insufficient abstraction. They often arise from trying to do too much in one place, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. Refactoring long methods into smaller, more focused functions helps create a more modular and maintainable codebase, which is easier to extend and less prone to bugs. In Rust, this also allows for better leveraging of the type system and ownership model to ensure correctness and safety throughout the code.
</p>

## 2.3.3. Large Class
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The large class code smell occurs when a class grows excessively large, accumulating too many responsibilities. This often happens when a class tries to do too much, encompassing multiple aspects of a system's functionality that should ideally be separated into distinct classes. Large classes can be difficult to understand, maintain, and test, and they often violate the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change. In Rust, while the language encourages a more functional style and composition, the concept of large structs with numerous methods and fields can still emerge, leading to similar issues as in other object-oriented languages.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example in Rust:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
struct Order {
    id: u32,
    items: Vec<Item>,
}

struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}

struct Item {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    price: f64,
}

struct OrderManager {
    orders: Vec<Order>,
    customers: Vec<Customer>,
    inventory: Vec<Item>,
}

impl OrderManager {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            orders: Vec::new(),
            customers: Vec::new(),
            inventory: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_order(&mut self, order: Order) {
        self.orders.push(order);
    }

    fn find_order(&self, order_id: u32) -> Option<&Order> {
        self.orders.iter().find(|&order| order.id == order_id)
    }

    fn add_customer(&mut self, customer: Customer) {
        self.customers.push(customer);
    }

    fn find_customer(&self, customer_id: u32) -> Option<&Customer> {
        self.customers.iter().find(|&customer| customer.id == customer_id)
    }

    fn add_item_to_inventory(&mut self, item: Item) {
        self.inventory.push(item);
    }

    fn check_inventory(&self, item_id: u32) -> bool {
        self.inventory.iter().any(|item| item.id == item_id)
    }

    fn process_order(&mut self, order_id: u32) -> Result<(), String> {
        let order = self.find_order(order_id).ok_or("Order not found".to_string())?;
        for item in &order.items {
            if !self.check_inventory(item.id) {
                return Err("Item not in inventory".to_string());
            }
        }
        // Further processing logic
        Ok(())
    }

    fn notify_customer(&self, customer_id: u32, message: &str) {
        // Mock notification logic
        if let Some(customer) = self.find_customer(customer_id) {
            println!("Notified customer {}: {}", customer.name, message);
        } else {
            println!("Customer not found.");
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut order_manager = OrderManager::new();

    // Adding some items to inventory
    order_manager.add_item_to_inventory(Item { id: 1, name: "Laptop".to_string(), price: 1000.0 });
    order_manager.add_item_to_inventory(Item { id: 2, name: "Smartphone".to_string(), price: 500.0 });

    // Adding a customer
    order_manager.add_customer(Customer { id: 1, name: "John Doe".to_string() });

    // Adding an order
    order_manager.add_order(Order { id: 1, items: vec![Item { id: 1, name: "Laptop".to_string(), price: 1000.0 }] });

    // Processing the order
    match order_manager.process_order(1) {
        Ok(()) => {
            println!("Order processed successfully.");
            order_manager.notify_customer(1, "Your order has been processed");
        }
        Err(e) => println!("Error processing order: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>OrderManager</code> struct is responsible for managing orders, customers, and inventory. It has methods for adding and finding orders, customers, and items in inventory, as well as for processing orders and notifying customers. The class has grown large and unwieldy, with responsibilities ranging from data management to business logic and customer interaction.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The large class issue can be addressed by breaking down the <code>OrderManager</code> into smaller, more focused components. This involves identifying distinct areas of responsibility and creating separate structs for each. Hereâ€™s a refactored version:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the necessary structures
struct Order {
    id: u32,
    items: Vec<Item>,
    customer_id: u32,
}

struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}

struct Item {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    price: f64,
}

// Implement the OrderService
struct OrderService {
    orders: Vec<Order>,
}

impl OrderService {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { orders: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_order(&mut self, order: Order) {
        self.orders.push(order);
    }

    fn find_order(&self, order_id: u32) -> Option<&Order> {
        self.orders.iter().find(|&order| order.id == order_id)
    }
}

// Implement the CustomerService
struct CustomerService {
    customers: Vec<Customer>,
}

impl CustomerService {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { customers: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_customer(&mut self, customer: Customer) {
        self.customers.push(customer);
    }

    fn find_customer(&self, customer_id: u32) -> Option<&Customer> {
        self.customers.iter().find(|&customer| customer.id == customer_id)
    }
}

// Implement the InventoryService
struct InventoryService {
    inventory: Vec<Item>,
}

impl InventoryService {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self { inventory: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn add_item_to_inventory(&mut self, item: Item) {
        self.inventory.push(item);
    }

    fn check_inventory(&self, item_id: u32) -> bool {
        self.inventory.iter().any(|item| item.id == item_id)
    }
}

// Implement the NotificationService
struct NotificationService;

impl NotificationService {
    fn notify_customer(&self, customer_id: u32, message: &str) {
        println!("Notified customer {}: {}", customer_id, message);
    }
}

// Implement the OrderProcessor
struct OrderProcessor {
    order_service: OrderService,
    inventory_service: InventoryService,
    notification_service: NotificationService,
}

impl OrderProcessor {
    fn new(order_service: OrderService, inventory_service: InventoryService, notification_service: NotificationService) -> Self {
        Self {
            order_service,
            inventory_service,
            notification_service,
        }
    }

    fn process_order(&mut self, order_id: u32) -> Result<(), String> {
        let order = self.order_service.find_order(order_id).ok_or("Order not found".to_string())?;
        for item in &order.items {
            if !self.inventory_service.check_inventory(item.id) {
                return Err("Item not in inventory".to_string());
            }
        }
        // Further processing logic
        self.notification_service.notify_customer(order.customer_id, "Your order has been processed");
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create services
    let mut order_service = OrderService::new();
    let mut inventory_service = InventoryService::new();
    let notification_service = NotificationService;

    // Add some items to inventory
    inventory_service.add_item_to_inventory(Item { id: 1, name: "Laptop".to_string(), price: 1000.0 });
    inventory_service.add_item_to_inventory(Item { id: 2, name: "Smartphone".to_string(), price: 500.0 });

    // Create a customer
    let mut customer_service = CustomerService::new();
    customer_service.add_customer(Customer { id: 1, name: "John Doe".to_string() });

    // Create an order
    let order = Order {
        id: 1,
        items: vec![Item { id: 1, name: "Laptop".to_string(), price: 1000.0 }],
        customer_id: 1,
    };
    order_service.add_order(order);

    // Create an order processor
    let mut order_processor = OrderProcessor::new(order_service, inventory_service, notification_service);

    // Process the order
    match order_processor.process_order(1) {
        Ok(()) => println!("Order processed successfully."),
        Err(e) => println!("Error processing order: {}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the refactored code, we've separated the concerns into distinct services: <code>OrderService</code>, <code>CustomerService</code>, <code>InventoryService</code>, and <code>NotificationService</code>. Each service is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, such as managing orders, customers, or inventory, and handling notifications. The <code>OrderProcessor</code> struct then coordinates these services to process an order, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This decomposition not only makes the code more modular and easier to understand, but it also simplifies testing and maintenance. Each service can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, reducing the likelihood of unintended side effects when changes are made. Additionally, this design allows for more straightforward extension or replacement of individual services without impacting the entire system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In Rust, leveraging the strong type system and module organization can further enhance this separation. Structs and traits can be used to define clear interfaces and behaviors, promoting encapsulation and modularity. By addressing the large class code smell, developers can build more maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems.
</p>

## 2.3.4. Feature Envy
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The feature envy code smell occurs when a method in a class is more interested in the data of another class than in the data of its own class. This often manifests as a method accessing the fields or methods of another class excessively, rather than working with its own class's data. This can indicate poor encapsulation and a lack of proper responsibility distribution, as the method may belong more naturally in the class it is envious of.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following example in Rust, where a <code>CustomerService</code> struct is overly interested in the details of a <code>Customer</code> struct:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Customer struct
struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    address: String,
    email: String,
    loyalty_points: u32,
}

impl Customer {
    // Constructor to create a new Customer
    fn new(id: u32, name: String, address: String, email: String, loyalty_points: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            name,
            address,
            email,
            loyalty_points,
        }
    }
}

// Define the CustomerService struct
struct CustomerService;

impl CustomerService {
    // Print the customer's address
    fn print_customer_address(&self, customer: &Customer) {
        println!("Customer Address: {}", customer.address);
    }

    // Print the customer's email
    fn print_customer_email(&self, customer: &Customer) {
        println!("Customer Email: {}", customer.email);
    }

    // Print the customer's loyalty points
    fn print_customer_loyalty_points(&self, customer: &Customer) {
        println!("Customer Loyalty Points: {}", customer.loyalty_points);
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new Customer
    let customer = Customer::new(
        1,
        "Alice Smith".to_string(),
        "123 Main St, Springfield".to_string(),
        "alice.smith@example.com".to_string(),
        150,
    );

    // Create a new CustomerService
    let customer_service = CustomerService;

    // Print customer details
    customer_service.print_customer_address(&customer);
    customer_service.print_customer_email(&customer);
    customer_service.print_customer_loyalty_points(&customer);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>CustomerService</code> struct has methods that are focused on accessing and printing the data fields of the <code>Customer</code> struct. This indicates that <code>CustomerService</code> is overly interested in the <code>Customer</code> data, rather than manipulating or managing its own data or behavior. Each method in <code>CustomerService</code> primarily exists to interact with the data of <code>Customer</code>, demonstrating feature envy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address this issue, these responsibilities can be moved to the <code>Customer</code> struct itself. This refactoring allows the <code>Customer</code> struct to encapsulate its own data and behaviors, ensuring that operations related to customer details are handled within the class that owns the data:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Customer struct
struct Customer {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    address: String,
    email: String,
    loyalty_points: u32,
}

impl Customer {
    // Constructor to create a new Customer
    fn new(id: u32, name: String, address: String, email: String, loyalty_points: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            name,
            address,
            email,
            loyalty_points,
        }
    }

    // Print the customer's address
    fn print_address(&self) {
        println!("Customer Address: {}", self.address);
    }

    // Print the customer's email
    fn print_email(&self) {
        println!("Customer Email: {}", self.email);
    }

    // Print the customer's loyalty points
    fn print_loyalty_points(&self) {
        println!("Customer Loyalty Points: {}", self.loyalty_points);
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new Customer
    let customer = Customer::new(
        1,
        "Alice Smith".to_string(),
        "123 Main St, Springfield".to_string(),
        "alice.smith@example.com".to_string(),
        150,
    );

    // Call methods to print customer details
    customer.print_address();
    customer.print_email();
    customer.print_loyalty_points();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By moving these methods into the <code>Customer</code> struct, we improve encapsulation and respect the principle of object-oriented design where data and behavior are bound together. Now, instead of having an external service interested in the internal details of <code>Customer</code>, the <code>Customer</code> struct itself provides methods to access and manage its data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This refactoring not only makes the code more intuitive but also enhances maintainability. The <code>Customer</code> struct now has clear ownership of its data and responsibilities. If the representation of <code>Customer</code> data changes (for example, if the <code>address</code> becomes a complex object), these changes are localized within the <code>Customer</code> struct, rather than requiring changes in <code>CustomerService</code>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, this separation of concerns reduces coupling between classes. The <code>CustomerService</code> no longer needs to know the internal structure of the <code>Customer</code> class, making it easier to modify and extend the system. This approach also adheres to the Law of Demeter, which advises minimizing the knowledge one object has about the structure or properties of another.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, feature envy is a code smell indicating poor encapsulation and responsibility distribution. In the Rust code above, refactoring the methods to belong to the <code>Customer</code> struct where they naturally fit improves the design by ensuring that operations on data are encapsulated within the data's owning type. This change enhances the clarity, maintainability, and flexibility of the codebase.
</p>

## 2.3.5. Data Clumps
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The data clumps code smell occurs when a group of variables frequently appears together across the codebase. These variables often represent a logical unit of data but are treated separately, leading to redundant and scattered code. This can result in a maintenance burden, as any changes to the grouped data require updates across multiple locations in the code. Moreover, the lack of a cohesive structure for these related variables can lead to confusion and errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following Rust example where a <code>User</code> struct contains multiple fields that are often used together but are not encapsulated into a single cohesive structure:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the User struct
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    address: String,
    email: String,
    phone_number: String,
}

impl User {
    // Constructor to create a new User
    fn new(id: u32, name: String, address: String, email: String, phone_number: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            name,
            address,
            email,
            phone_number,
        }
    }

    // Print the user's contact information
    fn print_contact_info(&self) {
        println!("Email: {}", self.email);
        println!("Phone Number: {}", self.phone_number);
    }

    // Update the user's contact information
    fn update_contact_info(&mut self, email: String, phone_number: String) {
        self.email = email;
        self.phone_number = phone_number;
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new User
    let mut user = User::new(
        1,
        "John Doe".to_string(),
        "456 Elm St, Metropolis".to_string(),
        "john.doe@example.com".to_string(),
        "555-1234".to_string(),
    );

    // Print the initial contact information
    println!("Initial Contact Information:");
    user.print_contact_info();

    // Update contact information
    user.update_contact_info(
        "john.doe@newdomain.com".to_string(),
        "555-5678".to_string(),
    );

    // Print the updated contact information
    println!("\nUpdated Contact Information:");
    user.print_contact_info();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>User</code> struct has separate fields for <code>email</code> and <code>phone_number</code>, which are often used together in methods like <code>print_contact_info</code> and <code>update_contact_info</code>. These fields, representing the user's contact information, are treated as distinct variables, leading to potential redundancy and scattered handling of related data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address the data clumps code smell, we can refactor the code to encapsulate the related variables into a separate struct, creating a more coherent and maintainable design. Hereâ€™s a refactored version:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the ContactInfo struct
struct ContactInfo {
    email: String,
    phone_number: String,
}

impl ContactInfo {
    // Constructor to create a new ContactInfo
    fn new(email: String, phone_number: String) -> Self {
        Self { email, phone_number }
    }
}

// Define the User struct
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
    address: String,
    contact_info: ContactInfo,
}

impl User {
    // Constructor to create a new User
    fn new(id: u32, name: String, address: String, contact_info: ContactInfo) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            name,
            address,
            contact_info,
        }
    }

    // Print the user's contact information
    fn print_contact_info(&self) {
        println!("Email: {}", self.contact_info.email);
        println!("Phone Number: {}", self.contact_info.phone_number);
    }

    // Update the user's contact information
    fn update_contact_info(&mut self, email: String, phone_number: String) {
        self.contact_info = ContactInfo::new(email, phone_number);
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new User with initial contact information
    let mut user = User::new(
        1,
        "John Doe".to_string(),
        "456 Elm St, Metropolis".to_string(),
        ContactInfo::new("john.doe@example.com".to_string(), "555-1234".to_string()),
    );

    // Print the initial contact information
    println!("Initial Contact Information:");
    user.print_contact_info();

    // Update contact information
    user.update_contact_info(
        "john.doe@newdomain.com".to_string(),
        "555-5678".to_string(),
    );

    // Print the updated contact information
    println!("\nUpdated Contact Information:");
    user.print_contact_info();
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this refactored version, the <code>ContactInfo</code> struct is introduced to group the <code>email</code> and <code>phone_number</code> fields together. The <code>User</code> struct now contains a <code>ContactInfo</code> field, encapsulating the related contact details into a single unit. Methods like <code>print_contact_info</code> and <code>update_contact_info</code> operate on the <code>contact_info</code> field, reflecting the logical grouping of related data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This refactoring offers several benefits:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhanced Cohesion:</strong> The <code>ContactInfo</code> struct logically groups related fields, making it clear that these fields belong together. This improves the coherence of the data model.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduced Redundancy:</strong> By encapsulating related data, we avoid redundant updates and manipulations. Changes to contact information are managed in one place.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Improved Maintainability:</strong> The code becomes more maintainable because related operations are consolidated into a single struct. Adding or modifying contact-related fields is more straightforward.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Better Abstraction:</strong> The encapsulation of contact information in a separate struct provides a clear abstraction, making the <code>User</code> struct simpler and more focused on its own responsibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, the data clumps code smell points to a design issue where related variables are scattered across the codebase instead of being grouped into cohesive structures. Refactoring to encapsulate these related variables into a dedicated struct improves the design by enhancing cohesion, reducing redundancy, and making the codebase more maintainable and understandable.
</p>

## 2.3.6. Primitive Obsession
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The primitive obsession code smell occurs when primitive types are overused in place of more meaningful domain-specific objects. This often leads to code that is difficult to understand and maintain, as primitives lack the context and constraints that more specialized types can provide. In Rust, while primitives are simple and efficient, relying too heavily on them for complex tasks can result in a codebase where critical concepts are not encapsulated properly, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a Rust example where a <code>Transaction</code> struct uses primitive types for transaction types and amounts, rather than defining more descriptive types:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the Transaction struct
struct Transaction {
    id: u32,
    transaction_type: u32, // 0 for deposit, 1 for withdrawal
    amount: f64,
    description: String,
}

impl Transaction {
    // Constructor to create a new Transaction
    fn new(id: u32, transaction_type: u32, amount: f64, description: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            transaction_type,
            amount,
            description,
        }
    }

    // Check if the transaction is a deposit
    fn is_deposit(&self) -> bool {
        self.transaction_type == 0
    }

    // Check if the transaction is a withdrawal
    fn is_withdrawal(&self) -> bool {
        self.transaction_type == 1
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new deposit transaction
    let deposit = Transaction::new(
        1,
        0, // Deposit
        1000.0,
        "Salary payment".to_string(),
    );

    // Create a new withdrawal transaction
    let withdrawal = Transaction::new(
        2,
        1, // Withdrawal
        150.0,
        "Grocery shopping".to_string(),
    );

    // Check and print if transactions are deposits or withdrawals
    println!("Deposit Transaction:");
    println!("Is deposit: {}", deposit.is_deposit());
    println!("Is withdrawal: {}", deposit.is_withdrawal());

    println!("\nWithdrawal Transaction:");
    println!("Is deposit: {}", withdrawal.is_deposit());
    println!("Is withdrawal: {}", withdrawal.is_withdrawal());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, <code>transaction_type</code> is represented as a primitive <code>u32</code>, with <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> indicating deposit and withdrawal respectively. This approach can be problematic because it relies on arbitrary numbers to convey meaningful concepts. Itâ€™s easy to make mistakes or misunderstand the intended meaning of these numbers, which can lead to errors in handling transactions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address the primitive obsession code smell, we can define a more descriptive enum to represent transaction types and encapsulate related behaviors within it. This refactoring provides better readability and robustness by using a type that conveys more meaningful information and enforces valid values:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Define the TransactionType enum
enum TransactionType {
    Deposit,
    Withdrawal,
}

// Define the Transaction struct
struct Transaction {
    id: u32,
    transaction_type: TransactionType,
    amount: f64,
    description: String,
}

impl Transaction {
    // Constructor to create a new Transaction
    fn new(id: u32, transaction_type: TransactionType, amount: f64, description: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            transaction_type,
            amount,
            description,
        }
    }

    // Check if the transaction is a deposit
    fn is_deposit(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self.transaction_type, TransactionType::Deposit)
    }

    // Check if the transaction is a withdrawal
    fn is_withdrawal(&self) -> bool {
        matches!(self.transaction_type, TransactionType::Withdrawal)
    }
}

// Main function to demonstrate usage
fn main() {
    // Create a new deposit transaction
    let deposit = Transaction::new(
        1,
        TransactionType::Deposit,
        1000.0,
        "Salary payment".to_string(),
    );

    // Create a new withdrawal transaction
    let withdrawal = Transaction::new(
        2,
        TransactionType::Withdrawal,
        150.0,
        "Grocery shopping".to_string(),
    );

    // Check and print if transactions are deposits or withdrawals
    println!("Deposit Transaction:");
    println!("Is deposit: {}", deposit.is_deposit());
    println!("Is withdrawal: {}", deposit.is_withdrawal());

    println!("\nWithdrawal Transaction:");
    println!("Is deposit: {}", withdrawal.is_deposit());
    println!("Is withdrawal: {}", withdrawal.is_withdrawal());
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the refactored code, the <code>TransactionType</code> enum clearly represents the possible types of transactions. The use of an enum not only makes the code more readable but also provides type safety. The <code>Transaction</code> struct now uses <code>TransactionType</code> instead of <code>u32</code>, making it explicit which transaction types are valid and improving the self-documentation of the code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This approach offers several advantages:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Increased Readability:</strong> The <code>TransactionType</code> enum makes it clear what values are valid for transaction types, reducing the risk of confusion or misuse.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Type Safety:</strong> Using enums ensures that only valid transaction types are used, preventing errors that could occur with arbitrary numeric values.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulation of Behavior:</strong> The methods <code>is_deposit</code> and <code>is_withdrawal</code> now operate on well-defined enum variants, making the code more intuitive and easier to maintain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By refactoring to use domain-specific types like enums, we encapsulate concepts that were previously represented by primitive types, leading to a more expressive and maintainable codebase. This approach aligns with good design principles, making the code clearer and reducing the likelihood of errors related to misinterpreted or invalid primitive values.
</p>

## 2.3.7. Switch Statements
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The switch statements code smell occurs when a program frequently uses switch statements to handle variations in behavior based on different conditions or types. This often signals that the code might benefit from a more extensible design, such as polymorphism, which can make it easier to extend and maintain. Frequent switch statements can lead to code that is difficult to modify and understand, as every new case requires changes in multiple places, increasing the risk of errors and making the system less flexible.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider a Rust example where a <code>Shape</code> trait is implemented with a switch statement to compute the area of various shapes:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle(f64, f64),
    Triangle(f64, f64),
}

fn calculate_area(shape: &Shape) -> f64 {
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(radius) => std::f64::consts::PI * radius * radius,
        Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => width * height,
        Shape::Triangle(base, height) => 0.5 * base * height,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Shape::Circle(10.0);
    let rectangle = Shape::Rectangle(10.0, 20.0);
    let triangle = Shape::Triangle(10.0, 20.0);

    println!("Circle area: {}", calculate_area(&circle));
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", calculate_area(&rectangle));
    println!("Triangle area: {}", calculate_area(&triangle));
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, the <code>calculate_area</code> function uses a match statement to determine the type of shape and compute the area accordingly. While this works, it becomes unwieldy as more shapes are added. Each time a new shape type is introduced, the match statement must be updated, leading to code that is harder to maintain and extend.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address this issue, we can refactor the code to use polymorphism, leveraging Rust's trait system. By defining a trait <code>Shape</code> with a method <code>area</code>, we allow each shape to implement its own area calculation logic. This approach removes the need for a switch statement and centralizes the area computation within each shape:
</p>

trait Shape {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

impl Shape for Circle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        std::f64::consts::PI * self.radius * self.radius

{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the refactored code, we define a <code>Shape</code> trait with an <code>area</code> method. Each specific shape type (<code>Circle</code>, <code>Rectangle</code>, and <code>Triangle</code>) implements the <code>Shape</code> trait and provides its own implementation of the <code>area</code> method. The <code>print_area</code> function can now work with any type that implements the <code>Shape</code> trait, without needing to know the details of each shape.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This refactoring offers several benefits:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Adding new shapes is straightforward. New shape types simply need to implement the <code>Shape</code> trait, and the <code>print_area</code> function can handle them without modification.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Each shape type encapsulates its own area calculation logic, making the code easier to understand and maintain.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> The code no longer relies on a switch statement, reducing complexity and improving readability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By replacing switch statements with polymorphism, we make the code more flexible, extensible, and maintainable. This approach adheres to object-oriented design principles, making it easier to add new features and maintain the code over time.
</p>

## 2.3.8. Comments
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The comments code smell emerges when code contains excessive or misleading comments, which often indicates that the code itself may be unclear or poorly structured. Rather than relying on comments to explain complex or ambiguous code, it's generally better to write code that is self-explanatory and easy to understand. Comments should complement the code by explaining the "why" behind decisions, rather than the "what" or "how," which should be evident from well-written code.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Consider the following Rust example where excessive comments are used to explain each line of code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn calculate_discount(price: f64, discount_percentage: f64) -> f64 {
    // Start by calculating the discount amount
    let discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100.0); // Discount amount = price * (discount percentage / 100)
    
    // Subtract the discount amount from the original price
    let final_price = price - discount_amount; // Final price = original price - discount amount

    // Return the final price
    final_price // Return the final price after discount
}

fn main() {
    let price = 100.0; // Original price
    let discount_percentage = 15.0; // Discount percentage

    let discounted_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage);

    println!("Discounted price: {}", discounted_price); // Print the discounted price
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this example, each line of the code is accompanied by a comment explaining what the code does. While comments can be helpful, excessive comments can clutter the code and may suggest that the code itself is not clear enough. For example, the comments explaining the calculation of <code>discount_amount</code> and <code>final_price</code> are redundant because the calculations are straightforward and should be self-explanatory.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address this issue, we can refactor the code to improve clarity and minimize the need for comments:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn calculate_discount(price: f64, discount_percentage: f64) -> f64 {
    let discount_amount = price * (discount_percentage / 100.0);
    price - discount_amount
}

fn main() {
    let price = 100.0;
    let discount_percentage = 15.0;

    let discounted_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage);

    println!("Discounted price: {}", discounted_price);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the refactored code, the comments have been removed because the calculations are now straightforward and self-explanatory. The <code>calculate_discount</code> function directly returns the result of the price minus the discount amount, making the code more concise and easier to read. The <code>main</code> function initializes the <code>price</code> and <code>discount_percentage</code>, calls the <code>calculate_discount</code> function, and prints the result.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By focusing on writing clear and concise code, we reduce the need for excessive comments. Comments should be used to provide additional context or explain why certain decisions were made, rather than describing what the code is doing. For instance, if there were complex business logic or less obvious design choices, a comment explaining the rationale behind them would be appropriate.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, the comments code smell indicates that the code may not be clear enough and relies too heavily on comments to explain its purpose. By refactoring the code to be more self-explanatory and reducing the need for comments, we improve readability and maintainability, ensuring that comments are used effectively to complement the code rather than compensate for its lack of clarity.
</p>

# 2.4. Identifying Code Smells
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Identifying code smells is a critical practice in maintaining the quality and readability of a codebase. In Rust, several tools and techniques can assist developers in detecting code smells and improving the overall design of their code. These tools not only help in identifying potential issues but also provide mechanisms for automating code reviews and enforcing best practices.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One effective approach for detecting code smells in Rust is leveraging static analysis tools. Static analysis involves examining code without executing it, to identify patterns or anomalies that might indicate code smells. Rust's tooling ecosystem provides several crates that can assist in this process. For example, the <code>clippy</code> crate is a popular linter for Rust that offers a comprehensive set of linting rules to catch common mistakes and suggest improvements. Clippy helps identify issues such as redundant code, potential bugs, and areas where code could be optimized.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Here's how you might use <code>clippy</code> in a Rust project:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Add <code>clippy</code> to your project as a dependency by running:</p>
{{< prism lang="shell">}}
  cargo install clippy
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Run <code>clippy</code> to analyze your code:</p>
{{< prism lang="">}}
  cargo clippy
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Clippy will provide feedback on various code smells and suggest improvements. For example, if your code has a method that is excessively long or a function that could be simplified, Clippy will highlight these issues and offer suggestions for refactoring.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to Clippy, the <code>rustfmt</code> crate is another valuable tool for maintaining code quality. While <code>rustfmt</code> primarily focuses on formatting, it can also aid in improving code readability, which indirectly helps in identifying and addressing code smells. By applying consistent formatting rules, <code>rustfmt</code> makes it easier to spot areas where code might be unnecessarily complex or poorly structured.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To use <code>rustfmt</code>, add it to your project and format your code:
</p>

{{< prism lang="">}}
cargo install rustfmt
cargo fmt
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another technique for detecting code smells is performing code reviews, which involve manually inspecting code to identify potential issues. Rustâ€™s ecosystem supports code reviews through collaborative tools like GitHub and GitLab, where developers can use pull requests to review changes and discuss potential improvements. During code reviews, developers can look for common code smells such as duplicated code, long methods, and large classes. Code review tools can integrate with Rust's linter and formatting tools to provide a comprehensive view of code quality.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Rustâ€™s ecosystem also includes tools for managing and automating code quality tasks. For instance, <code>cargo-audit</code> is a crate that helps identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies, which can be related to code smells if not properly addressed. By regularly running <code>cargo audit</code>, developers can ensure their codebase remains secure and free of known vulnerabilities.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hereâ€™s how to use <code>cargo-audit</code>:
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Install <code>cargo-audit</code>:</p>
{{< prism lang="shell">}}
  cargo install cargo-audit
{{< /prism >}}
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Run an audit to check for vulnerabilities:</p>
{{< prism lang="">}}
  cargo audit
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Overall, leveraging Rustâ€™s tools and techniques for detecting code smells helps maintain a high-quality codebase. By using crates like Clippy and Rustfmt, performing thorough code reviews, and automating quality checks with tools like <code>cargo-audit</code>, developers can effectively identify and address code smells, ensuring their code remains clean, efficient, and maintainable.
</p>

# 2.5. Impact of Code Smells
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Code smells, while often subtle, can have significant repercussions on a software project, contributing to technical debt and impacting various aspects of the system's performance, maintainability, scalability, and readability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When code smells are present, they typically indicate underlying problems that, if left unaddressed, can accumulate into technical debt. Technical debt refers to the cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or quick solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer. Code smells such as duplicated code, long methods, and large classes often result from or contribute to technical debt. They may offer short-term convenience but can lead to increased complexity and a greater burden of maintenance in the long run. For example, duplicated code may require updates in multiple places if changes are necessary, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The impact on performance can vary depending on the nature of the code smell. For instance, long methods that perform multiple tasks might not only be difficult to understand but could also be less efficient if they include unnecessary or redundant operations. While not always immediately apparent, these inefficiencies can accumulate and affect the overall performance of the application.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Maintainability is profoundly affected by code smells. Code that is difficult to understand or poorly structured, such as that which contains extensive use of comments to explain complex logic, can be harder to modify and debug. When code smells are present, making changes or enhancements requires more effort and increases the risk of introducing new bugs. This issue is compounded as the codebase grows, leading to a maintenance burden that can slow down development and increase the likelihood of errors.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Scalability is another area that suffers when code smells are present. For instance, a class with too many responsibilities (large class smell) can become a bottleneck as the system scales. When the responsibilities are not well-defined and encapsulated, adding new features or scaling the system may require significant rework and can lead to a fragile architecture that is difficult to extend.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Readability is directly impacted by code smells as well. Code that is cluttered with excessive comments, long methods, or poorly structured classes can be challenging to read and understand. This decreased readability makes it harder for new developers to onboard and for existing developers to quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of the code. As a result, development efficiency can decrease, and the codebase becomes more prone to errors and misunderstandings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, code smells contribute to technical debt and negatively impact performance, maintainability, scalability, and readability. Addressing code smells proactively is essential for maintaining a healthy codebase, ensuring that the system remains efficient, easy to maintain, and adaptable to future requirements. Ignoring code smells can lead to escalating issues that hinder the project's progress and increase the long-term cost of software development.
</p>

# 2.6. Case Studies
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In exploring the impact and resolution of code smells, real-world case studies from Rust projects provide valuable insights. These examples illustrate common issues and demonstrate how they were effectively addressed to improve code quality and maintainability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
One notable example of code smells in a Rust project involves a large codebase dealing with complex data transformations. In a project that processed and analyzed large datasets, a key problem was the presence of <strong>duplicated code</strong> across multiple modules. The duplicated code revolved around similar data manipulation functions that were scattered across various files. This duplication not only made the codebase harder to maintain but also increased the risk of inconsistencies and bugs when updates were required.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address this issue, the development team refactored the code to use a more modular and reusable approach. They introduced a dedicated utility module containing generic functions for data transformation. For instance, rather than having separate implementations for data normalization and scaling in different parts of the codebase, they created a single set of functions in a module like <code>data_utils.rs</code>:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
fn main() {
    let mut data = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0];
    normalize(&mut data);
    println!("Normalized data: {:?}", data);

    scale(&mut data, 2.0);
    println!("Scaled data: {:?}", data);
}

pub fn normalize(data: &mut [f64]) {
    let max = data.iter().cloned().fold(f64::NEG_INFINITY, f64::max);
    let min = data.iter().cloned().fold(f64::INFINITY, f64::min);
    let range = max - min;
    if range != 0.0 {
        for value in data.iter_mut() {
            *value = (*value - min) / range;
        }
    }
}

pub fn scale(data: &mut [f64], factor: f64) {
    for value in data.iter_mut() {
        *value *= factor;
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
By centralizing these functions, the team reduced redundancy, improved maintainability, and facilitated easier updates. This refactor also improved code readability, as developers could now refer to a single location for data transformation logic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another case study involved a Rust project where a <strong>long method</strong> was identified within a key business logic function. This method, responsible for processing user input and generating reports, had grown excessively long and complex, incorporating multiple responsibilities such as validation, parsing, and formatting. The complexity made it difficult to understand and maintain, increasing the likelihood of bugs and making future enhancements challenging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The team decided to decompose the long method into smaller, more manageable functions. For example, they refactored a method that handled user data processing into separate functions for validation, parsing, and report generation:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
// Struct Definitions with Debug trait for Error
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Report;
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ParsedData;
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Error;

// Main function to process user data
fn process_user_data(user_data: &str) -> Result<Report, Error> {
    let validated_data = validate_user_data(user_data)?;
    let parsed_data = parse_user_data(&validated_data)?;
    generate_report(&parsed_data)
}

// Function to validate user data
fn validate_user_data(user_data: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    // Validation logic (for now, assume validation is always successful)
    Ok(user_data.to_string())
}

// Function to parse the validated data
fn parse_user_data(validated_data: &str) -> Result<ParsedData, Error> {
    // Parsing logic (for now, assume parsing is always successful)
    Ok(ParsedData)
}

// Function to generate a report from the parsed data
fn generate_report(parsed_data: &ParsedData) -> Result<Report, Error> {
    // Report generation logic (for now, assume report is always generated successfully)
    Ok(Report)
}

// Main function to run the program
fn main() {
    let user_data = "sample data";
    // Attempt to process the user data and match the result
    match process_user_data(user_data) {
        Ok(report) => println!("Report generated successfully!"),
        Err(e) => println!("Error processing user data: {:?}", e),
    }
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This refactor improved the methodâ€™s readability and maintainability by isolating each responsibility into distinct functions. Each function could now be understood, tested, and maintained independently.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In another instance, a Rust project dealing with user settings configurations exhibited <strong>feature envy</strong>. Methods within a user management module were frequently accessing internal data from a settings module to perform their functions, indicating that the user management module was overly reliant on the settings module.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To resolve this issue, the team applied the <strong>Law of Demeter</strong> principle, also known as the principle of least knowledge. They refactored the code to encapsulate settings access within a dedicated configuration service, which provided a clean API for retrieving and modifying settings. This refactor shifted responsibility to the configuration service, reducing the coupling between modules and clarifying the data ownership:
</p>

{{< prism lang="rust" line-numbers="true">}}
use std::collections::HashMap;

// Define types
struct Settings {
    map: HashMap<String, SettingValue>,
}

impl Settings {
    // Get a setting value by key
    pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Option<&SettingValue> {
        self.map.get(key)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum SettingValue {
    String(String),
    Integer(i32),
    Boolean(bool),
    // Add more as needed
}

struct ConfigService {
    settings: Settings,
}

impl ConfigService {
    pub fn new(settings: Settings) -> Self {
        Self { settings }
    }

    pub fn get_setting(&self, key: &str) -> Option<&SettingValue> {
        self.settings.get(key)
    }
}

struct UserManager {
    config_service: ConfigService,
}

impl UserManager {
    pub fn new(config_service: ConfigService) -> Self {
        Self { config_service }
    }

    pub fn apply_user_settings(&self, user_id: u32) {
        let setting_value = self.config_service.get_setting("user_preference");
        match setting_value {
            Some(value) => {
                // Apply setting_value to user profile
                println!("Applying setting {:?} for user {}", value, user_id);
            }
            None => {
                println!("No setting found for user {}", user_id);
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Sample data
    let mut settings_map = HashMap::new();
    settings_map.insert("user_preference".to_string(), SettingValue::String("dark_mode".to_string()));

    let settings = Settings { map: settings_map };
    let config_service = ConfigService::new(settings);
    let user_manager = UserManager::new(config_service);

    // Apply settings for a user
    user_manager.apply_user_settings(1);
}
{{< /prism >}}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This change reduced direct interactions with the settings module and improved the modularity of the system, facilitating better maintenance and scalability.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
These case studies highlight the practical application of addressing code smells in Rust projects. By refactoring to eliminate duplication, simplify complex methods, and reduce feature envy, teams can enhance code quality, making it more maintainable, readable, and scalable. Each example underscores the importance of identifying and resolving code smells to manage technical debt effectively and improve the overall health of a codebase.
</p>

# 2.7. Strategies for Addressing Code Smells
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Addressing code smells effectively requires a combination of refactoring techniques and adherence to best practices and design principles. These strategies not only help in eliminating existing code smells but also serve to prevent their emergence in future code.
</p>

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Refactoring is a core technique for addressing code smells. It involves restructuring existing code without altering its external behavior to improve its internal structure. One of the primary refactoring techniques is <strong>extracting methods.</strong> This technique is used to break down long, complex methods into smaller, more manageable ones. By isolating distinct responsibilities into separate methods, the code becomes more readable and maintainable. For instance, a method performing multiple tasks such as data validation, transformation, and presentation can be decomposed into individual methods, each handling a specific aspect of the process.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Another essential refactoring technique is <strong>extracting classes.</strong> This approach is used when dealing with large classes that have too many responsibilities. By identifying distinct responsibilities within a class, developers can create new classes to handle specific tasks. This refactor promotes the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring that each class has a clear, focused purpose. For example, if a class is responsible for both managing user data and handling user notifications, it can be refactored into two separate classes, each handling one responsibility.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encapsulating fields</strong> is a technique used to address the code smell of feature envy and excessive exposure of class internals. By making class fields private and providing controlled access through getter and setter methods, developers ensure that the class maintains control over its data. This encapsulation not only protects the integrity of the data but also reduces the coupling between classes, making the code more resilient to changes.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">To prevent code smells from arising in the first place, adopting best practices and design principles is crucial. One such principle is the <strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP),</strong> which states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. By adhering to SRP, developers ensure that each component of the system has a clear and focused purpose, reducing the likelihood of large, unwieldy classes and methods.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Open/Closed Principle (OCP) i</strong>s another vital principle. It dictates that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism, allowing code to be extended with new features without altering existing code. By designing systems that adhere to OCP, developers can avoid issues such as long methods and large classes, as the system's structure accommodates changes more gracefully.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Code reviews</strong> are a practical best practice for preventing and addressing code smells. Regular code reviews by peers can help identify potential issues early, ensuring that code quality standards are maintained. During reviews, developers should look for signs of code smells such as redundant code, complex methods, and large classes. Feedback from code reviews can guide refactoring efforts and reinforce adherence to best practices.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Automated testing</strong> also plays a critical role in maintaining code quality. By writing comprehensive unit tests and integration tests, developers can ensure that changes made during refactoring do not introduce new bugs. Automated tests provide a safety net that allows developers to refactor code with confidence, knowing that any regressions will be caught early.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, employing <strong>design patterns</strong> can help in structuring code to avoid common code smells. Design patterns such as the <strong>Factory Method, Strategy,</strong> and <strong>Observer</strong> patterns provide tested solutions for common design problems, promoting modularity and reducing the likelihood of code smells. For instance, the Strategy pattern can help in managing complex conditional logic by encapsulating algorithms in separate classes, thus reducing the reliance on lengthy switch statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In summary, addressing code smells involves a combination of refactoring techniques, adherence to design principles, and best practices. By extracting methods and classes, encapsulating fields, and adhering to principles like SRP and OCP, developers can improve code quality and maintainability. Complementing these efforts with regular code reviews, automated testing, and the application of design patterns ensures that code remains clean, efficient, and resilient to change.
</p>

# 2.8. Conclusion
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Continuous monitoring and improvement of code quality are essential for ensuring that a software system remains performant, maintainable, scalable, and readable over time. As applications grow and evolve, codebases can become complex, introducing potential inefficiencies and technical debt. By regularly assessing and refining the code, developers can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, simplify complex structures, and remove unnecessary dependencies, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and clarity of the code. This ongoing effort also facilitates better collaboration among team members, as clean and well-documented code is easier to understand and modify. Moreover, a commitment to quality fosters a proactive approach to scalability, ensuring that the system can adapt to increasing demands and new requirements. Ultimately, continuous improvement not only extends the lifespan of the software but also reduces maintenance costs and improves user satisfaction by delivering a more reliable and responsive product.
</p>

## 2.8.1. Advices
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As a senior Rust programmer, writing clean, maintainable code requires a deep understanding of both Rust's language features and broader software design principles. One of the primary considerations in avoiding code smells is leveraging Rust's strong type system and ownership model. These features inherently encourage safe memory management and concurrency, but they also guide developers toward clearer and more expressive code structures. For example, instead of relying on raw pointers or unnecessary <code>unsafe</code> blocks, prefer using smart pointers like <code>Box<T></code>, <code>Rc<T></code>, or <code>Arc<T></code> to manage memory safely and convey ownership semantics clearly. This practice not only reduces the likelihood of memory leaks or data races but also makes the code self-documenting by explicitly indicating ownership and borrowing relationships.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another critical aspect is modularity. Rust's modules and visibility rules (<code>pub</code>, <code>pub(crate)</code>) allow fine-grained control over the accessibility of code components. Properly using these features helps encapsulate implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces, thereby minimizing the 'inappropriate intimacy' code smell. Additionally, the judicious use of traits can help decouple functionalities and provide flexible interfaces, making it easier to extend and maintain the codebase. Traits should be designed to be coherent and minimal, avoiding overly general trait bounds that could lead to 'speculative generality.' Instead, focus on defining specific, purpose-driven traits that capture the essential behaviors of the types they are associated with.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address issues related to 'long methods' or 'large classes,' Rust developers should strive for composability. This involves breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable units and favoring functional-style programming where possible. Iterators and closures can be powerful tools for expressing complex data transformations succinctly and safely. By chaining iterator methods, developers can often avoid verbose and error-prone loops, leading to cleaner and more expressive code. Moreover, using Rust's pattern matching and algebraic data types (enums) effectively can help manage complex state transitions and avoid the pitfalls of 'switch statements' and excessive conditional logic. Enums, combined with exhaustive pattern matching, allow for clear and concise handling of different cases, reducing the risk of unhandled scenarios.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Refactoring is a vital practice in maintaining code quality and preventing code smells from accumulating. It requires regularly revisiting and revising the codebase, not just to add new features but also to improve existing implementations. Automated tools like Clippy can assist in identifying potential issues, but manual code reviews are indispensable. These reviews should focus not only on correctness but also on readability, maintainability, and adherence to idiomatic Rust practices. When refactoring, aim to replace repetitive patterns with abstractions such as functions, methods, or macros, thereby reducing duplication and improving code clarity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, a culture of testing and documentation is essential. Tests, especially property-based testing and fuzzing, help ensure that refactoring efforts do not introduce regressions and that the code behaves as expected across a wide range of inputs. Documentation, both in the form of comments and more formal API documentation using Rustdoc, is crucial for communicating the intent and usage of code components. However, excessive or redundant comments should be avoided as they can become stale or misleading; instead, strive for clear and expressive code that minimizes the need for explanatory comments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Finally, staying updated with the latest developments in the Rust ecosystem, such as new language features, libraries, and best practices, is crucial. This ongoing learning process helps developers leverage the latest tools and techniques to write cleaner, more efficient code. By adhering to these principles and continuously improving one's craft, Rust developers can create robust, efficient, and maintainable software that is free of common code smells.

- <p style="text-align: justify;">Explain how Rust's ownership and borrowing system can help prevent or exacerbate code smells like duplicated code or long methods. Provide sample code illustrating both a problematic and an improved implementation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Discuss the implications of excessive use of <code>unsafe</code> in Rust as a potential code smell. Include sample code demonstrating risky <code>unsafe</code> usage and refactored versions using safe Rust patterns.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">What are signs of 'primitive obsession' in Rust, especially with basic types like <code>&str</code>, <code>String</code>, and <code>Vec<T></code>? Provide examples of this code smell and demonstrate how newtypes and other patterns can resolve it.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">How can 'feature envy' manifest in Rust, where one module excessively accesses the data of another? Provide a sample code scenario illustrating this smell and suggest refactoring strategies to improve encapsulation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Analyze the 'large class' code smell in Rust using structs and enums. Present examples of overly complex structs and demonstrate how Rustâ€™s trait system can be used to modularize functionality.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Describe how overusing pattern matching with <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code> in Rust can lead to the 'switch statements' code smell. Provide examples and discuss alternative approaches, like using polymorphism through traits.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">What are best practices in Rust for avoiding the 'long method' code smell? Include sample code showing a refactor from a long method to a more modular design using closures and iterators.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Examine the 'data clumps' code smell in Rust. Show examples where related data is improperly grouped and discuss how to use tuples, structs, and enums to organize data more effectively.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">How does the 'inappropriate intimacy' code smell appear in Rust, particularly concerning module visibility (<code>pub</code> and <code>pub(crate)</code>) and encapsulation? Provide code samples and refactoring suggestions.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Discuss the impact of excessive comments in Rust code as a code smell. Provide examples of overly commented code and refactor it to be more self-documenting using Rust's type system and expressive syntax.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">In Rust, how can the 'lazy class' code smell be identified, where a struct or module does too little? Include examples of such cases and discuss scenarios where merging or splitting components might be appropriate.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">How can the 'shotgun surgery' code smell be detected in a Rust codebase, especially with tightly coupled modules or functions? Provide examples and discuss strategies for reducing coupling.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Explore the 'parallel inheritance hierarchies' code smell in Rust, particularly with traits and trait objects. Include sample code that demonstrates this issue and refactor it using trait composition and delegation.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Identify the 'temporary field' code smell within Rust structs. Provide examples of improper usage and demonstrate how optional types (<code>Option<T></code>) and builder patterns can mitigate this issue.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Describe the 'speculative generality' code smell in Rust, particularly with generic types and trait bounds. Provide examples and discuss best practices to avoid unnecessary abstraction, with sample code.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Analyze the 'message chains' code smell in Rust, especially with method chaining and builder patterns. Include examples and discuss how to refactor such code to enhance readability and maintainability.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Discuss the 'middle man' code smell in Rust, where a module excessively delegates responsibilities. Provide sample code demonstrating this smell and discuss when removing or simplifying such intermediaries is beneficial.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">How does the 'refused bequest' code smell appear in Rust when implementing traits? Include examples of improper trait method usage and discuss best practices to ensure proper adherence to trait contracts.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Discuss the 'divergent change' code smell in Rust, particularly with enums and pattern matching. Provide examples and discuss refactoring strategies to move towards a more cohesive design.</p>
- <p style="text-align: justify;">Examine the 'commented-out code' code smell in Rust. Provide examples of commented-out code, discuss the potential issues it introduces, and suggest best practices for keeping the codebase clean.</p>
